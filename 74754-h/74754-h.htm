SCHOOLMATES</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MISS JEWETT had just rung the bell and the
children trooped into the schoolroom, taking
their places as quietly as exuberant youthful spirits
would permit, the smallest boys and girls in the
front row, the older ones further back. It was a
cheerful room, and Elizabeth, by the side of her chum,
Betsy, thought of the changes which had taken place
there since Miss Jewett was installed as teacher.
Where had been bare walls, except for a couple of
uninteresting maps, now were attractive pictures
which brought visions of all sorts of delightful historical
places; shelves in front of the windows displayed
gay, blossoming plants, while in an aquarium,
standing in their midst, gold-fish darted about. In
the centre of the black-board Miss Jewett had just
drawn the picture of a man and woman in Puritan
dress; a big yellow pumpkin ornamented one corner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
of the board, in another was a turkey, in the third
an ear of corn and in the fourth a squirrel nibbling
a nut. The pictures were drawn with colored chalks
and there was not a child who did not look upon
them with sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>“Thanksgiving,” the whisper went around. Miss
Jewett nodded. “Yes, Thanksgiving, and when we
come to our history lesson I will tell you how our
first Thanksgiving Day originated and why we still
keep it in remembrance.” Then Miss Jewett took
up her violin and drew the bow across the strings.
She paused a moment before she began to play.
“We will sing a very old hymn this morning,” she
said, “one that was written by a man named Kethe,
away back in the sixteenth century, and it might
well have been sung by the Pilgrim Fathers on that
first Thanksgiving Day. It is very quaintly worded,
I think. You may all look for it in your hymnals;
it begins: ‘All people that on earth do dwell,’ and
we shall sing it to the tune Old Hundred, for that
seems most appropriate, as the tune is as old as the
hymn.”</p>

<p>She started the first note and Elizabeth gave a
quick sigh of pleasure. It was a constant surprise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
and delight to her to find how many things Miss
Jewett could do: she could play the violin and sing
sweetly, if not very powerfully; she could draw
wonderful things on the board; she wore the daintiest
and most becoming clothes and she made the lessons
a pleasure instead of a task. Surely she was the
most wonderful teacher in the world, and Elizabeth
adored her. “Anything more like an angel than
Miss Jewett could not possibly be,” she confided to
Betsy at recess, “especially when she plays the
violin.”</p>

<p>“But angels play on harps,” objected Bess Ferguson
who had joined them.</p>

<p>“They don’t always,” returned Elizabeth, “for
I’ve seen pictures of them with violins; Betsy’s uncle
Rob has one among the photographs he brought from
Europe.”</p>

<p>That settled it and Bess had no more to say; indeed,
Elizabeth had a way of forcing unanswerable
arguments upon this less quick-witted friend of hers,
and it was seldom that she did not get the best of it.
Just here Flo Harris came up and was greeted cordially;
she was not often invited to join this trio,
for it was an understood thing that Elizabeth with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
her first best friend, Betsy, and her second best,
Bess, did not care for an addition to the group at
lunch time. It was regarded as a privilege when
another girl was admitted; Flo, however, had special
claims upon this occasion, for this was her first appearance
after some weeks of illness. She was still
rather pale and thin, and the girls regarded her with
something like admiring envy.</p>

<p>“Come right over here, Flo,” Elizabeth invited
her. “We have a lovely lunch today. Betsy has
some of those great big red grapes that grow in her
aunt’s garden, Bess has some special cakes and I
have a special jar of marmalade. You’re well
enough to eat anything now, aren’t you?” she asked
a little anxiously.</p>

<p>“Oh dear, yes,” returned Flo, accepting the attentions
offered, “but I have been awfully ill; I
wasn’t expected to live.”</p>

<p>The three girls gazed at her with new interest.
The phrase, “not expected to live” had a weird
fascination for them all, Elizabeth especially. She
had never reached such a danger point, although
she had gone through an ordeal during the summer
when an accident threatened to rob her of her sight.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
“Well,” she said, “I was never quite that bad, although
I did nearly have my eyes put out.”</p>

<p>“And once I was awfully ill with measles,” put in
Bess.</p>

<p>“Yes, but you were never where they gave you
up,” returned Flo in triumph. “There was one
night when, my mother said, the doctor declared
that he didn’t expect I would live till morning.”
Again the alluring phrase.</p>

<p>Elizabeth offered another spoonful of marmalade,
Betsy laid half a second bunch of grapes in Flo’s
lap and Bess added her last cake, from which she
had just taken one bite.</p>

<p>“You look so lovely and pale,” said Elizabeth
admiringly. “I would give anything to be pale; it
is so interesting. I think when I die I would like to
languish away,” she added sentimentally, “although
I wouldn’t like to have a worm feed on my damask
cheek.”</p>

<p>“Who had that?” inquired Flo with interest.</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you know the poetry that says a
worm in the bud fed on her damask cheek?”</p>

<p>At this a merry little chuckle sounded from just
above them and Miss Jewett’s bright face looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
out from the window; “Elizabeth, you funny girl,”
she said, “you don’t get that quotation right; it is:
‘And let concealment, like a worm i’ the bud, feed
on her damask cheek.’”</p>

<p>“I always thought it was a worm, a real live
worm,” replied Elizabeth, quite taken aback. “I
don’t believe I understand it yet, Miss Jewett.”</p>

<p>“Neither do I,” spoke up Flo.</p>

<p>“Why, it means this: that the young woman concealed
her love and the effort to do so showed its
effect; concealment took her vitality, the rose from
her cheek, and made her pale—just as a worm in
the bud of a rose destroys it.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” The girls saw the point. “I am rather
glad it is that way,” decided Elizabeth, “for I cannot
bear any kind of worm, and Betsy is always
teasing by putting caterpillars on me; I dislike them
more than spiders. Miss Jewett, did you know that
Flo wasn’t expected to live?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I heard the sad news at the time. We are
very thankful to have her back again, aren’t we?
I hope she will get some roses into her pale cheeks.”</p>

<p>“I think it is nice to be pale,” remarked Elizabeth
honestly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>“Oh dear me, what a notion,” exclaimed Miss
Jewett. “It is much nicer to be rosy and healthy
and strong and active.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth looked doubtful. She was generally
very ready to adopt Miss Jewett’s opinions, but she
could not give up this treasured idea at once though
she did not say so; instead she asked solemnly,
“Miss Jewett, were you ever at the point of death?”</p>

<p>Miss Jewett smiled. “I believe so, when I was a
child.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth sighed regretfully. “I never was.”</p>

<p>“You think it is something to boast of?” said
Miss Jewett. “Why?”</p>

<p>Elizabeth cast about in her mind for a true reason,
but she could not settle upon a satisfactory one. “I
don’t know exactly,” she answered at last, “but we
girls always do. I suppose it is just like having the
biggest or the finest or the rarest of anything; we
feel proud of it because it goes ahead of what the
rest have.”</p>

<p>Miss Jewett laughed. “That is not a bad explanation,
Elizabeth. You use your mind very well,
though one doesn’t always want to be the biggest
in all directions.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>“No,” returned Elizabeth with conviction, “I
shouldn’t want to be the biggest liar or thief, for
instance.”</p>

<p>They all laughed, Miss Jewett included. “You’d
better come in now,” she said. “We want to have
that Thanksgiving story, you remember.”</p>

<p>“But that won’t even be a fib,” retorted Elizabeth
merrily.</p>

<p>“No, we can depend upon its being solid fact,”
returned her teacher.</p>

<p>Having disposed of the last remnant of marmalade,
the final grape and the remainder of the cake, the
girls shook the crumbs from their laps and went inside
to hear the story of the first Thanksgiving, and
then to go forth, somewhat earlier than usual, for
their holiday. On the way home there was great
talk of the next day’s jollification. Miss Jewett and
her aunt, Miss Dunbar, were to dine at Betsy Tyson’s,
and the afternoon Betsy and Elizabeth were
to spend together at the home of the latter. This
was determined upon after Betsy explained that she
would be left alone otherwise. “There will be no
one at home,” she told her friends, “for uncle Rob
and Hal are going to the football game with Miss
Jewett and your sister Kathie, Elizabeth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>“What will your aunt Emily do?” queried Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“She and Miss Dunbar are going to take tea with
Mrs. Lynde.”</p>

<p>“And I have to stay at home,” complained Bess.
“Grandma said she couldn’t think of my going away
from home on Thanksgiving.”</p>

<p>“It will be rather stupid, won’t it?” said Elizabeth
compassionately.</p>

<p>“Yes, it will,” returned Bess in an aggrieved
voice. “I wish you and Betsy would come over and
spend the afternoon with me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but—” Elizabeth began and looked at
Betsy. There was never much fun in visiting at
Mrs. Lynde’s; everything was so spick and span, so
very orderly. Mrs. Lynde did not like any noise
and would not permit anything out of place. The
girls never had as good a time anywhere as at Elizabeth’s
home, the least pretentious among them all.
For this holiday Betsy and Elizabeth had planned a
specially entertaining afternoon and were not ready
to give it up.</p>

<p>“I promised Elizabeth I would spend the afternoon
with her,” said Betsy doubtfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>“Couldn’t you possibly come to my house, Bess?”
asked Elizabeth. Although Bess would not be any
great addition to the proposed play, Elizabeth was
quite willing to include her.</p>

<p>Bess shook her head. “No, grandma and mamma
both said I must stay with them.”</p>

<p>“Oh dear! Well then they won’t want us,” decided
Elizabeth, “for on a holiday like Thanksgiving
we wouldn’t think of going unless they particularly
invited us, would we, Betsy?” Elizabeth
was rather pleased with herself at having found a
way out of the difficulty.</p>

<p>“But if I ask them they will invite you,” persisted
Bess.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be the same,” Elizabeth was positive.
“They probably will go to drive and will want you
with them; there wouldn’t be room for us and so
you see we’d only be in the way.” Elizabeth spoke
forcibly, the slower Bess finding no answering
argument.</p>

<p>“You’ll have lovely things to eat,” Elizabeth went
on, trying to console Bess, “and you’ll wear that
beautiful new frock, of course. We might run in
for a teentsy-weentsy minute to see you in it, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
church, you know. We could do that, couldn’t we?”
She turned to Betsy to receive her assenting nod,
and Bess, pleased at the prospect of displaying her
finery, gave up further urging.</p>

<p>“Walk up to the next corner with me, Betsy,”
said Elizabeth to her first best as they left Bess at
her own gate, and Betsy agreed.</p>

<p>“I never saw anyone like you, Elizabeth,” said
the latter admiringly. “You always know just what
to say to Bess to make her satisfied. We really
didn’t exactly want her, did we? Yet she wasn’t a
bit offended.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mind her coming to our house,” declared
Elizabeth; “it was only that I didn’t want to go to
hers. It would be as dry as pine needles to sit around
in that stiff way, as they do at her house. We
couldn’t jump about or run or make the least noise,
for Bess would have to be careful of her new frock,
and we’d have to talk in whispers and do some crazy
fancy work or something. That reminds me, Betsy,
I have a lovely idea for Christmas. If you will come
over some rainy Saturday we can flabricate something
nice.”</p>

<p>“What?” asked Betsy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>“Why, some little sachets, not sachets exactly,
either—scent bags. I thought of them long ago,
and I gathered all the sweet-smelling leaves and
things I could from the garden to put in the bags:
lemon verbenas, rose leaves, bergamot, rose geranium,
lavender, and oh,—lots. I’ll give you some. My
only trouble is to find bits of silk or ribbon to make
the bags of; Kathie confisticates everything of that
kind.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what we can do,” returned Betsy;
“we can swap. I’ll furnish the pieces and you can
furnish the filling. Aunt Emily is very nice about
letting me have pieces; she likes to encourage me in
doing fancy work,” Betsy laughed. “I could have
gathered sweet things from our garden, too,” she
went on, “but I didn’t think of it and it is too late
now, so the best I can do is to supply the outsides
while you supply the insides.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s lovely of you, Betsy,” responded Elizabeth
appreciatively. “Of course it is too late to
get garden things now, for the frost has nipped everything,
and besides they have to be dried. Won’t it
be something nice to look forward to for the next
rainy day? We’ll go up into my playroom and make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
the bags; it will be quite light by the window, you
know, even if it is in the attic. I speak to make the
prettiest for Miss Jewett.”</p>

<p>“Oh dear,” responded Betsy disappointedly, “I
was just going to say that myself; you always do
get ahead of me, Elizabeth.”</p>

<p>“Why, no, I don’t, but—I suppose it wouldn’t
do for each of us to give her one, would it? Even if
they were different. Well, I will tell you what; if
I think of anything just as nice I’ll agree to your
having the prettiest piece and to giving that bag to
Miss Jewett.”</p>

<p>“And if you don’t think of anything, what then?”</p>

<p>“Then maybe you will.”</p>

<p>“Now, Elizabeth, you know I am not anything
like as clever as you about having ideas for such
things.”</p>

<p>“You flatter me, your serene highness. All right,
then I can ask Kath; she knows of lots of things to
make and she will show me how when I tell her the
good cause. I’ll give up the bag if you want it so
much.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I am a mean, selfish worm,” sighed
Betsy, “but it does go to the spot to have anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
as nice as that for Miss Jewett, and besides she is to
be my aunt, you know, and I have the right to give
her the best.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth inwardly resented this, but there was
no denying the fact, to her mind, and she could answer
only: “Woe is me, that she is not to be mine,
but you know something else; we’ll have the same
brother and sister after awhile.”</p>

<p>They stopped at the corner, Betsy declaring she
could not go a step further; therefore, walking backwards,
they called to one another till Elizabeth,
stumbling against the protruding roots of a tree,
thought best to face about, calling over her shoulder:
“See you at church tomorrow.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small><span class="smcap">Prisoners</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ELIZABETH and Betsy were left in possession.
Even Electra had the afternoon and evening
off on Thanksgiving Day. Elizabeth’s big brother,
Dick, with his chum, Hal Tyson, Betsy’s brother,
had gone to a football game, taking Kathie and
one of her girl friends. Mr. and Mrs. Hollins had
determined upon a drive, after the hearty Thanksgiving
dinner, and had taken Babs with them to
see some relatives five miles distant, while Bert had
been allowed to go to the game, too.</p>

<p>“I don’t know about leaving you two little girls
all alone,” said Mrs. Hollins doubtfully, as she was
putting on her hat. “Don’t you think you’d
better come with us? We can take the surrey
just as well as the buggy, and then there will be
plenty of room.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dearest love-mother, we don’t want to go,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
replied Elizabeth. “We’d so much rather stay here
and play by ourselves. We will not get into any
mischief, I solemnly asseverate. We’re going to
play up in my playroom and the attic and we will
be right there when you come back. We’ve eaten
so much dinner that we shall not want to descend
to the nether regions for any food and we will be as
safe as crickets under a big stone.”</p>

<p>“You ridiculous child, I hope you will be safe. I
will see that the outside doors and windows are
fastened and we will take the latch-key. If you
promise to play in the attic and not to do anything
with matches or fire, I think I can trust you.”</p>

<p>“We won’t have a single sentiment of fire or
matches and we will be just as good as pie,—as the
pumpkin pie we had for dinner. I’ll tell you what
we’re going to play, mother. It is very much according
to the day, a historical sort of entertainment:
we’re going to play Mayflower and Plymouth
Rock and Indians. I’ve thought it all out.
The big chest is to be Plymouth Rock and the old
rocking-chair the Mayflower. You won’t mind our
hitching the chair along the floor a little so as to
make it more like sailing. I haven’t decided whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
I shall be John Alden or Myles Standish; maybe I
can be both. Betsy is going to be Priscilla, and we
are going to be very historical and thankful, so
you see we shall not have any chance of getting
into mischief.”</p>

<p>“Then if that is the case I can leave you. There
are ginger-snaps in the stone jar in the pantry, if
you get hungry.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I don’t believe the Pilgrims had ginger-snaps,
do you? Perhaps they had plum-duff. I
don’t know what that is exactly, but it sounds
Englishy and old-fashioned. But if our muscles need
refreshment after our arduous journey we will
seek the stone jar, mother.”</p>

<p>“Betsy will stay with you till someone comes, I
suppose.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, for Dick is coming home after the football
game and of course Hal will come, too, and
one of them can take Betsy home. Besides, Bert
will be back before the rest because he has gone on
his wheel to the game.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then I think I need not worry about
you. I see your father coming with the buggy, so
I must go.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>“Good-bye, then, dearest mother Alden. Kiss
me farewell, for your son John is going on a long
journey across seas to a new country. Ye good
ship Mayflower bears him away.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, son John,” returned Mrs. Hollins,
falling into Elizabeth’s make-believe. “I hope
your journey will be all you expect. We shall try
to be back by dark,” and, responding to Babs’
vociferous call, Mrs. Hollins went out.</p>

<p>“Now then,” said Elizabeth, not waiting to see
her parents off, “we will hie to the ship, Priscilla.”</p>

<p>They rushed off upstairs, a corner of which was
given over to Elizabeth for a playroom. Here she
kept her favorite books, her dolls, her treasures of
various kinds. But the girls did not settle down in
this usually favored place; instead they took possession
of the middle of the attic, pulling a huge,
old-timey rocking-chair to the point opposite a big
chest. Betsy, with a handkerchief tied over head
and a cheesecloth dust-cloth used as a kerchief for
her shoulders, established herself in the chair, while
Elizabeth hunted up a wide-brimmed felt hat of her
brother Dick’s and a Norfolk jacket that she might
be properly attired. By dint of mighty rockings they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
managed to hitch along the chair towards its destination,
although it was slow work.</p>

<p>“Do not be cast down, Priscilla,” said the would-be
John. “We shall reach our haven in good time.
Methinks I see a faint upheaval yonder which has a
degree of permeance not like the restless sea.” She
shaded her eyes with one hand and peered forwards.
“Aha!” she cried, “I am right. It is a mighty
rock, and to it we will strive to make our way. Art
glad, Priscilla?”</p>

<p>“Truly I am and very thankful,” responded
Betsy. “I like not these buffeting waves.”</p>

<p>“Marry, neither do I!” replied Elizabeth. “It
is a long and wearisome voyage we have made, but
there is land at last.” She climbed to the seat of
the chair and waved her hat vigorously, crying,
“Land! Land!” But her violent demonstrations
were too much for the clumsy craft, for it lurched
backwards and the two voyagers were spilled out.
They were not hurt, however, but scrambled up
laughing and rubbing their elbows. “That was a
mighty wave indeed,” cried Elizabeth. “A little
more and we had been drowned, Priscilla. We
must now wade ashore and reach the rock.” With<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
much pretended effort they managed to do this,
clambering to the top of the chest and falling upon
their knees in thankfulness.</p>

<p>The next thing was to build themselves a house,
which they did from some broken chairs and discarded
umbrellas. But it was too tame a matter to
sit there for very long, and Elizabeth rushed off
to hunt game, returning breathless and reporting
the meeting of a fierce savage. Leaving their house
behind them, they escaped to the house of a neighbor,
where, for no reason at all, they declared themselves
safer, and where suddenly John Alden changed
into Myles Standish, to go forth doughtily and
fight the Indians. Priscilla was also transformed
into a man, electing to be William Bradford.</p>

<p>However, they soon tired of battling with Indians
and decided that something more sentimental
would be to their liking. “I’ll tell you what,” said
Elizabeth; “there’s an old spinning-wheel somewhere
about; we can get that and you can be Priscilla
and say, ‘Why don’t you speak for yourself,
John?’ You can be sitting at the wheel and be
singing the hymn we had at school yesterday, and I
will come in. I think there is an old hymn-book<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
in the store closet where mother packs away the
winter clothes. It is locked, but the key is hanging
right by the door.”</p>

<p>They dragged forth the old spinning-wheel, after
Priscilla had resumed her maidenly dress, and
then they went to hunt up the dilapidated hymn-book
which Elizabeth remembered having seen on
the shelf of the locked closet. It was a Yale lock, but
easily opened, and in a few moments they were
inside the closet, which was really like a little room
and was lighted by a small window high in the side.
Elizabeth rummaged around and at last found the
book.</p>

<p>“Here it is,” she announced. “Now we will see
if the same hymn is in it.”</p>

<p>They sat down together on a box and began
looking over the book. “What a queer smell this
room has,” said Betsy.</p>

<p>“It is the camphor balls,” Elizabeth told her.
“Mother has been unpacking some of the clothes
for winter and I came across a paper box of the
balls while I was looking for the book. Here’s the
hymn all right, Betsy. Now, come, let’s go back.”</p>

<p>But this was easier said than done, for, upon trying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
the door, they found it had swung to and was
locked, the key being still on the outside.</p>

<p>“Now we’ve done it,” cried Elizabeth. “We
are prisoners, Betsy, for there is no possible way of
getting out.”</p>

<p>“What shall we do?” cried Betsy, looking distressed.</p>

<p>“We can’t do anything till the family come home.
We shall just have to stay here and amuse ourselves
the best we can; it won’t be so very long. They
will miss us and will come up to look, then when
we hear them we will bang on the door and call to
them.”</p>

<p>“But it may not be for ever so long after they
get back.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, it will, for they will know we don’t
want to stay up here in the dark. We can really
play just as well in here even if it is smelly. We
can pretend we are prisoners taken by the Indians,
or that we are hiding from them and don’t dare to
come out.”</p>

<p>Somewhat comforted, Betsy accepted the situation
with a good grace, though they did not find
playing prisoner a particularly exciting game and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
soon wearied of it. In the face of bare walls and not
much space Elizabeth’s imagination failed her and
they sat down rather crestfallen to wait rescuers.</p>

<p>They had been silent for about five minutes when
suddenly Elizabeth jumped up, saying, “I know
what we can do; we can play jacks with the moth
balls.”</p>

<p>“That is an idea,” Betsy said in a pleased voice.
“It will be much better than sitting still doing
nothing.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth lifted the box of moth balls from the
shelf. They cleared a space on the top of the box
where they had been sitting, and, squatting down
upon the floor, they began the game. The novelty
of their playthings lasted till dark began to set in
and they could no longer see to play. The little
room was so dimly lighted that it was really not so
late as it seemed, even on this November afternoon.
They were not uncomfortable for there were parcels
of blankets and such things wrapped in paper and
piled up on the floor; these they leaned against,
taking various positions as they became restless.</p>

<p>“It isn’t so very warm, is it?” said Betsy, after
a long silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>“No, but we can easily get out something to
wrap ourselves up in. I think if we were to lie
down we might be more comfortable. We can
make a bed of some of these big packages; it won’t
hurt, and I will get out a blanket to put over us.”</p>

<p>This was a new arrangement and they laughingly
prepared to lie down, cuddling under a heavy blanket
and feeling quite satisfied to wait events. It grew
darker and darker. It was very still in the house
and very still in the little room; only the sound of
gentle breathing came from the pallet on the floor.</p>

<p>In course of time the various members of the family
returned. First came Bert, who, finding that the
door was locked, did not attempt to get in, but
went off to Patsy McGonigle’s to see how he had
fared upon Thanksgiving Day. Next came a
merry party of young people. Dick had a latch-key
and let in the crowd. They went into the parlor
and began to sing college songs, then Neal Paine
proposed that all go over to his house.</p>

<p>“I’m jolly hungry myself, after that long ride,”
he said, “and we’ve a barrel of oysters sent up for
Thanksgiving, so what’s the matter with going over,
all of us, and having an oyster roast?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>“First-rate,” agreed Hal.</p>

<p>“So say we all of us,” Dick seconded him. So
out they all rushed across the street, leaving the
house to silence though not to utter darkness.</p>

<p>Not long after this the wheels of the buggy
crunched up the driveway. Mrs. Hollins and Babs
alighted and Mr. Hollins drove off to the barn.
“By the looks of things I should say that Dick and
the rest had returned,” remarked Mrs. Hollins as
she entered the lighted room. “I wonder where the
little girls are. Perhaps Elizabeth has walked
home with Hal and Betsy,” and, leisurely taking
off her coat and hat, she sat down to unfasten
Babs’s wraps.</p>

<p>Presently Mr. Hollins came in. “Where are the
youngsters?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know,” replied Mrs. Hollins.
“The boys have evidently been here. I haven’t
been upstairs, but I imagine that Elizabeth has
walked home with Betsy and Hal; perhaps they all
went off together, though Elizabeth promised to be
here when I returned. Suppose you call up and see
if she is at the Tysons’s.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hollins went to the ’phone, returning in a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
minutes with the report that there was no response
to the call. “They’re all away, I suppose,” he said.
“I noticed that the house was quite dark as we
came by. Perhaps the girls have gone to Bess
Ferguson’s. I’ll try there.” The reply to his query
was that neither of the girls was there and had not
been since early in the day.</p>

<p>“I will go upstairs and hunt around,” said Mrs.
Hollins; “perhaps they are in the house after all.”
Leaving Babs with her father, Mrs. Hollins mounted
the stairs and searched through all the rooms on
the next floor, then she took a lamp and went up
into the attic. Here were signs of the late presence
of Elizabeth and her friend, Betsy. The big chair
still lay where it had been overturned, the spinning-wheel
loomed up dimly before the window, a bow
and arrow of Bert’s lay on the floor, garments were
strewn around. “Elizabeth will have to come up tomorrow
and set things to rights,” murmured Mrs.
Hollins, as she looked around with a half smile.
Then she called softly, “Elizabeth, Elizabeth!”
But there was no answer. After waiting a moment
Mrs. Hollins went slowly downstairs to rejoin her
husband. “I can’t find them anywhere,” she told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
him. “I’ve been all over the house. Where do
you suppose they can be?”</p>

<p>“Here comes Bert,” said Mr. Hollins, “perhaps
he can give us some light on the subject.”</p>

<p>Bert came whistling up on the porch and in a
moment came in. “Hallo,” he said, “you’ve got
back, haven’t you? Gee! but it was a fine game.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen anything of your sister Elizabeth?”
inquired his mother.</p>

<p>“Not a sign. When I got back the house was all
locked up so I went over to see Patsy. The McGonigles
had roast pork and sweet corn and potatoes,
and they were just as thankful as anything.”
Bert never lost an opportunity of bringing to light
the virtues of the McGonigles.</p>

<p>“Never mind what the McGonigles had,” said
Mr. Hollins; “what we are more interested in is
the whereabouts of your sister.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet she is hiding somewhere just to give us a
scare,” declared Bert.</p>

<p>“Then you can go and find her,” suggested his
father.</p>

<p>Upstairs and down tramped Bert, storming at
last into the attic whose shadows and dark corners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
were rather disheartening to even an older person.
Bert did not advance very far into the dim recesses,
but, standing in the doorway, shouted stentoriously,
“’Lizbeth! I say, ’Lizbeth, where are you?”</p>

<p>Then something happened. Mrs. Hollins appeared
with a lamp. “I have just thought,” she
murmured, and went straight to the door of the
closet. She saw the key sticking in the lock, turned
it and looked in to see an auburn head closely
snuggled by the side of a dark brown one.</p>

<p>Bert peered around his mother’s shoulder. “Well,
I’ll be switched if they’re not asleep,” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Betsy sat up and rubbed her eyes. “It’s very
smelly in here,” she remarked.</p>

<p>Bert went off into shouts of laughter which
awakened his sister.</p>

<p>“You’ve come at last,” said Elizabeth, scrambling
from her improvised couch. “We thought you
never would come.”</p>

<p>“How long do you think I have been looking for
you?” asked her mother, with a smile. “A full
half hour. How did you happen to choose such a
place for a nap?”</p>

<p>“We didn’t choose it,” answered Elizabeth. “It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
chose us. We came in here to get a hymn-book
and the door had to go and close itself, so we were
locked in; we’ve been here for ages.”</p>

<p>“Then you’d better come out as quickly as you
can and get some fresh air. I don’t wonder you fell
asleep in that stuffy place.”</p>

<p>The girls were only too glad to obey, and at Mrs.
Hollins’s suggestion ran up and down the porch ten
times to get their lungs full of fresh air; then they
were ready for ginger-snaps and such things, their
Pilgrim days being over.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small><span class="smcap">The Piece Bag</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“ELIZABETH, you must set things to rights in
the attic,” said Mrs. Hollins the next day.
“Everything is in confusion there, and you know I
can’t allow that.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, mother, I will do it,” Elizabeth assured
her, “but you see we had to leave it so yesterday
because we were imprisoned, incartcerated.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hollins smiled. “You dearly like a redundancy
of letters in your words, don’t you, daughter?”</p>

<p>“What is redundancy?” inquired Elizabeth,
pleased at hearing a new word.</p>

<p>“It means more than enough.”</p>

<p>“I suppose Elizabeth thinks one cannot have too
much of a good thing,” remarked Dick, looking
up from his book. “The longer she can make the
word the better. Where were you ‘incartcerated,’
Elizabeth?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>“In the packing closet with the moth balls,” replied
his sister. “It was an awfully stuffy place.”</p>

<p>“I should think so, and it is a wonder you were
not asphyxiated,” returned Dick. “There is a good
long word for you, Libzie.”</p>

<p>“Say it again,” begged Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Dick repeated the word and Elizabeth slowly said
it after him. “Ass-fix-he-ate-ed. It would make a
lovely charade, Dick.”</p>

<p>Her brother put back his head and roared. “I’ll
bet you can’t spell it. I’ll give you a nickel if you
can.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth made several attempts but failed in each
one, so Dick finally had to tell her, and she carefully
wrote it down on a piece of paper that she might
puzzle Betsy when she should come, though at the
same time she maintained that she still thought it
would make a good charade. She was so intent upon
planning this out that she entirely forgot about the
condition of the attic and, as it was a bright, clear
morning, she decided that if she could gather an
audience and press Betsy into service they could act
charades out of doors.</p>

<p>However, she failed in her errand, because Betsy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
had gone to town with her aunt Emily and any sort
of play which demanded much imagination was not
worth attempting without Betsy. Bess claimed her,
however, always being rather pleased when, as second
best, she could demand the privileges of first best.</p>

<p>So all day the old rocking-chair lay on its back
while Elizabeth played with Bess. When night came
Mrs. Hollins reminded Elizabeth of her shortcomings.</p>

<p>“Elizabeth,” she said, “you did not do as I told
you about putting things in order up in the attic.
I went up there to get something and came near
hurting myself when I stumbled over the chair. You
must go up there the very first thing tomorrow and
don’t come down till you have put things where they
belong.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth was very contrite. “Oh dear, I am so
forgetless,” she sighed. “Did you hurt yourself
very badly, mother dear?”</p>

<p>“Oh no, not badly, although I might have done
so, and you know my rule is that you must put
back in its place anything taken away. I don’t in
the least object to your amusing yourself in any innocent
manner, and to your using anything that will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
help to make your play more pleasant, but I have
not the time to run after you and pick up after disorderly
little girls.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth accepted the reproof meekly. She knew
that with but one servant her mother had more
than enough to do, and she truly did not mean to
make more work for her, but once an idea took possession
of her it was to the exclusion of everything
else.</p>

<p>She went to bed in a very humble frame of mind
and decided before she went to sleep that she must
do something to make her remember another time.
Therefore, the next morning when Betsy appeared,
it being a rainy day, Elizabeth was still up in the
attic.</p>

<p>“You can go right up, Betsy,” Mrs. Hollins gave
permission. “I dare say you will find Elizabeth in
her playroom.”</p>

<p>Betsy ran up the stairs and called, but the voice
which answered did not come from the playroom.</p>

<p>“Why, where are you?” inquired Betsy, peering
around.</p>

<p>“Here!” The answer came from a dark corner.</p>

<p>Betsy made her way to the spot. “Why, what in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
the world are you doing sitting away off there?”
asked Betsy.</p>

<p>From the depths of the old chair Elizabeth replied:
“I am doing penance. I forgot all about
putting this back where it belongs, and mother
nearly broke her neck falling over it, so I have to do
something to make myself remember. I thought if
I sat here long enough I couldn’t possibly forget
where the chair belonged.”</p>

<p>“How long have you been there?” asked Betsy,
quite accustomed to Elizabeth’s methods of dealing
out punishments to herself.</p>

<p>“Oh, a long time. I don’t know exactly. I have
put away all the other things. It looks quite orderly—don’t
you think so?”</p>

<p>“It looks very nice indeed,” replied Betsy. “I
should have been here to help you, for it was as much
for me as for you that the things were used.”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t your attic and you were company,”
answered Elizabeth, settling that question.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think you can come now?” asked
Betsy. “I have some lovely pieces. Aunt Emily let
me bring a piece bag, and it is a rainy day, you
know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>This quite decided Elizabeth to put an end to her
punishment, and she came forth with alacrity, eager
to see what Betsy had brought.</p>

<p>“Aunt Emily was really very good about it,” said
Betsy, following her friend to the playroom. “She
said you were very generous to let me use your idea
for a scent bag and she liked my making it for Miss
Jewett. She said to tell you that you were to have
any pieces from this bag.”</p>

<p>“I think that is mighty kind of her,” said Elizabeth,
well pleased at this reward of virtue.</p>

<p>“Have you any new ideas?” asked Betsy anxiously,
still feeling that she was a little selfish to
take advantage of Elizabeth’s ingenuity.</p>

<p>“I have two lovely ones,” replied Elizabeth; “at
least they are not mine but they are things Kathie
showed me, and if I have the materials she will
show me how to make them.”</p>

<p>“Shall you make them both?” inquired Betsy.</p>

<p>“That depends. They are both so nice I don’t
know which to choose.”</p>

<p>“Tell me about them.”</p>

<p>“One is for handkerchiefs. You cover two squares
of pasteboard cut a little larger than a folded handkerchief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
and cover both sides, one with any pretty
piece of silk and the other side with white, then you
have a strap of elastic to hold them together when
you put the handkerchiefs inside. It doesn’t muss
the handkerchiefs, takes up no room and makes it
very handy for you to see just what you want when
you are looking for a handkerchief.”</p>

<p>“I should think that would be very nice,” declared
Betsy. “Now what is the other one?”</p>

<p>“It is a case for threaded needles. You take a
piece of ribbon about so long,”—Elizabeth measured
with her two hands a distance of a little less than
three quarters of a yard,—“and about so wide,”—she
measured again about three and a half inches.
“You sew one end over a piece of pasteboard the
length of the longest needle you intend to have and
you fasten in a strip of flannel not quite so long as the
ribbon and a little narrower, then you thread needles
with black silk and cotton and white silk and cotton;
you run them in and out the flannel, fold the ribbon
over and over, tie it together with a little narrow ribbon
and when you are in a great hurry or when you
are travelling you don’t have to stop to thread
needles.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>“I think that is fine,” returned Betsy, who had
listened attentively. “I believe I would like that
better than the scent bag.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth made no reply. She really liked it better
herself and had quite a feeling of triumph that she
had found something so simple and yet so useful.
But it would take quite a length of ribbon and she
was not at all sure she could find a piece exactly
suited. “Kathie says she has some flannel I can
use,” she remarked after awhile, “if only I can get
the ribbon. I suppose I could save up and buy it,
but I haven’t a great deal of time to save in, for
Christmas comes very soon after Thanksgiving, and
the pennies don’t come in as fast as the days fly by.
Besides, I need all I can get to buy what I most want
to get for mother.”</p>

<p>Betsy was absorbed in peeping into the bag she
held, and began to draw forth one piece after another.
Elizabeth watched her with interest. “There,” she
exclaimed, pouncing upon a bit of delicately flowered
silk, “that would just do for the scent bag.
Isn’t it pretty?” she added, holding it up. “Shall
you use that?” she asked.</p>

<p>“If I don’t see anything I like better,” answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
Betsy. “This might do for your handkerchief case,”
she went on, as she laid two ends of silk in Elizabeth’s
lap. They were not very pretty pieces, Elizabeth
thought, and she looked at them doubtfully.
Miss Jewett should have only the very loveliest, she
considered. “Maybe we can find something else,”
said Betsy, noticing Elizabeth’s expression.</p>

<p>“These are rather dark,” said Elizabeth,
brightening.</p>

<p>Betsy began diving deeper into the bag. Presently
she drew forth a fluttering end but quickly thrust it
back again, giving a keen glance at Elizabeth as she
did so and murmuring: “Oh, that wouldn’t do,” and
she fumbled again among the pieces. Presently she
brought forth from the collection a very pretty piece
of delicate blue silk sprinkled with tiny bunches of
flowers. “How would you like this?” she asked as
she laid it in Elizabeth’s lap.</p>

<p>“Oh, that is perfectly lovely!” cried Elizabeth.
“But wouldn’t it be big enough for your bag, Betsy?”</p>

<p>“Maybe, but I think I can find something else, or
I can take the other, the first one, if you like this
best.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I do like it best of anything, and I think you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
are very generous to let me have it. I am going to
run down and show it to Kathie and get her to measure,
though I am sure there will be loads to make it
the right size.” She ran off, saying as she went,
“I’ll be right back, Betsy.” She had been a little
disappointed that Betsy had not emptied the contents
of the bag that they might both look them over
together, but she did not think of this now that she
was so entirely satisfied with what had been given
her.</p>

<p>No sooner was she out of sight than Betsy hastily
drew out the end which she had thrust back and
held it up, a very rich and beautiful length of ribbon.
“It is the very prettiest yet,” murmured Betsy.
She reached over and took Elizabeth’s little tape-measure
from the work-basket which stood on the
chair near by. She measured the ribbon; it was just
three and a half inches wide and lacked a little of
being three quarters of a yard in length. “It is
exactly right,” said Betsy to herself. “I cannot let
her have it. After all I ought to let her give the scent
bag because it was her idea, and besides if I give her
the silk for it and don’t take any of the dried leaves
I will really be very generous.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>Still she did not feel exactly comfortable as she
smoothed out the ribbon on her lap and finally, at
the sound of Elizabeth’s approach, stuffed it down
into the very bottom of the bag, nor did she feel
any happier when Elizabeth said: “Kathie says
you are a dear. She thinks this is lovely and it
is big enough for either a scent bag or the handkerchief
case. I really think you ought to have it,
Betsy.”</p>

<p>But Betsy shook her head. “No, I don’t want it.
You must take it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am sure I am a thousand times obliged
to you,” said Elizabeth. “See, I have brought up
the little thread and needle case for you to see how
easy it will be to make; anyone could do it.”</p>

<p>Betsy took the proffered article in her hand and
examined it carefully. Yes, anyone could make it,
that was quite true. She thought of the ribbon in
the depths of the bag and tried to feel pleased.
“Wouldn’t you really like to make a scent bag better
than anything else for Miss Jewett?” she asked.
“Tell me truly, Elizabeth, if you had your choice
which of the three things would you rather give her?
Tell me truly. Cross your heart.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>Elizabeth went through the ceremony of crossing
her heart. “Well, if I had just the very handsomest
piece of ribbon, I believe I would rather give her
the thread and needle case than anything else, because
she would probably use it oftener than the
bag.”</p>

<p>“Not oftener than she would the handkerchief
case. She would think of you every time she saw
that, you know.”</p>

<p>“So she would. Well then, I should like to make
both.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think that is fair,” said Betsy. “It isn’t
fair for you to give her two presents when I have only
one, unless my one were very, very handsome.”</p>

<p>“But you wanted the scent bag; you know you
did, Betsy.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say I didn’t want it, did I? Besides,
you know you haven’t the ribbon to make the needle
and thread case even if you wanted to.”</p>

<p>“No, I know I haven’t, but we were talking of
what we would like best to give, not what we really
were able to. Have you decided upon what you will
take for your scent bag?”</p>

<p>“No, and I don’t think I will decide today.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
Maybe aunt Emily will come across some more
pieces. I wouldn’t begin on the handkerchief case
yet, Elizabeth.”</p>

<p>“Why not? It is such a nice rainy day, and Kathie
is at home to show me just how, and you know we
said we would begin the first rainy day so as to get
them done in time.”</p>

<p>Betsy looked uneasy. “I’m not going to begin
mine,” she declared.</p>

<p>“Oh, please, Betsy.”</p>

<p>Betsy shook her head.</p>

<p>“I know just why you aren’t going to,” Elizabeth
asserted; “it is because you have given me the nicest
piece and the only one that will do, and you are too
generous to say so. You have just got to take it
back and I will use that dark one.”</p>

<p>Betsy backed away as Elizabeth tried to force the
silk upon her. “I will not have it,” she maintained.
“I am not an Indian giver; besides, aunt Emily
said that you were to have anything in the bag you
wanted.” Betsy had a sharp pang of conscience as
she made this speech, remembering what was hidden
in the depths of the bag on her arm. “I must really
go, Elizabeth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>“But it is early and I did think we would have such
a good time.”</p>

<p>“I will come some other time.” Betsy hesitated
before continuing: “I wish you would put off doing
yours, too. There is no telling what we may get
after another hunt.”</p>

<p>“But I couldn’t have anything better than this,”
returned Elizabeth, giving the blue silk an admiring
look, “not if I searched the world over.”</p>

<p>“You’d better wait,” repeated Betsy and then she
went off, leaving Elizabeth feeling somewhat mystified
and rather disappointed.</p>

<p>As soon as Betsy reached home she went to her
room and drew forth the coveted bit of ribbon. Yes,
it was even more beautiful than she thought. She
had never seen anything of the kind that she admired
as much. Suppose her aunt Emily had made a
mistake in putting it in that special bag, or suppose
she should say that she had missed it and wanted to
use it herself. Even if she might have it her aunt
would question as to her use of it.</p>

<p>This Miss Emily did when, a little later, Betsy
went to her. “Could I have this, aunt Emily?” she
asked, producing the piece of ribbon. “It was in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
piece bag and you said we could have anything in
it.”</p>

<p>“Then if I said so I must keep my word,” replied
Miss Emily. “It is a very pretty piece of ribbon.
What do you intend to do with it?”</p>

<p>Betsy paused before she answered: “Elizabeth
showed me a very nice thread and needle case; I
thought I would like to make one for Christmas.”</p>

<p>“Whom would you give it to? It is such a very
handsome piece of ribbon you should not waste it
on merely anyone.”</p>

<p>“I thought I would give it to Miss Jewett.”</p>

<p>“What about the scent bag? I thought you had
decided upon that and that Elizabeth was to share
her gathered sweets with you.”</p>

<p>Betsy was silent before she said: “That was Elizabeth’s
own idea and I think she ought to be allowed
to keep it.”</p>

<p>Miss Emily smiled approbation. “In that case,
as a reward for your generosity in giving up the
more personal and original gift, I must certainly
allow you to have the ribbon.”</p>

<p>Betsy walked away feeling ashamed instead of
happy at receiving approval for something which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
she knew she did not quite deserve. She laid the
ribbon carefully away but she did not forget it.</p>

<p>Whether it was the commandment, “Thou shalt
not covet,” whether it was a sermon upon the subject
of petty deceits or whether it was her own tender
conscience is not certain, but there was a reason
somewhere which made Betsy very miserable all
the next day, not that her excuse in keeping the ribbon
was not a perfectly proper one, but because she
had pretended to a different motive from the real
one, and she knew she had received praise where no
praise was due. She wished she had never seen the
ribbon; she wished thread and needle cases had never
been invented; she almost wished there were no
Christmas.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small><span class="smcap">On Monday</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BETSY, who was always most eager to greet Elizabeth
on Monday mornings at school, did not feel
very enthusiastic about it on this present occasion;
Elizabeth was sure to hark back to the subject
of Christmas gifts; it was like her to be interested
in one thing to the exclusion of all others until the
matter had been well threshed out, unless something
much more exciting occurred to put it out
of her mind, so Betsy, instead of hurrying off as
usual to school, lagged behind, giving no answer
to the call which Elizabeth and Bess gave as they
passed by together, and arriving just at the very
last stroke of the bell. Elizabeth looked up beamingly
as she entered and gave Betsy’s hand an affectionate
squeeze when her desk-mate took the seat
by her side; but Betsy’s face wore such a solemn
expression that Elizabeth looked at her inquiringly,
receiving no response to her questioning glance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>When the hour for recess came Elizabeth’s first
question was: “Aren’t you well, Betsy? Has anything
happened?”</p>

<p>Betsy shook her head. “No, I feel cross; that is
all.”</p>

<p>“Then here is something to sweeten your disposition,”
returned Elizabeth laughingly. “I got up
early and made some fudge with marshmallows in
it. I brought this boxful to you; it is all for yourself,
because you were so dear and generous about the
silk pieces.”</p>

<p>Again! Betsy felt that she could not stand it
much longer. “Bother the silk pieces,” she cried.
“I wish you would stop talking about them.”</p>

<p>“Well, you are cross, sure enough,” said Elizabeth,
really feeling hurt at this reception of her gift.
“You’d better eat a piece of fudge and see if it
won’t do you good.”</p>

<p>But Betsy left the fudge untouched and had very
little to say during luncheon. When Bess rallied
her upon her silence Elizabeth shook her head and
whispered to Bess: “Don’t tease her; I don’t
believe she feels well.”</p>

<p>That her first best friend did not resent her ill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
temper was the crowning stroke, and before school
closed Betsy gave in. She slipped a little note into
Elizabeth’s hand, addressing her in the style they
adopted toward one another on such occasions, and
asking that Elizabeth would meet her at their trysting
place that afternoon. If she were not there
Elizabeth was to look for a message left in the usual
secret place.</p>

<p>Nothing pleased Elizabeth more than such messages.
She was usually the one to take the initiative
and to bid Betsy to the trysting place; it had been
some time since either of them had made an excuse
for such a meeting and it was therefore the
keener prospect. Elizabeth did not delay in reaching
the spot, but found no Betsy. She hastened to
the big stone, looked under it and found a small
package wrapped in heavy paper and securely
sealed. Wondering what it could contain, Elizabeth
broke the seals and found inside the heavy
paper another wrapping of soft white paper which
she unfastened—to find inside a length of beautiful
ribbon and a note; the note read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Frederica</span>,—This ribbon is for you. I have
a confession to make about it. I was meanly going to keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
it for myself. It was in the bag I brought to your house
and I found it and did not tell you nor show it to you
because I was a pig and didn’t want you to have it. You
thought I was generous when I was a mean, mean, selfish,
disgusting creature. Now I shall not be happy till you
take it for I cannot stand your thinking me generous when
I was not. If you forgive me run up the flag and I will
come and fall at your feet, crying, “<i>Peccavi</i>,” and throwing
myself on your mercy. If you do not forgive me I shall
be heart-broken.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">Your sinful and contrite,</span><br>

<span class="smcap">Phillipa</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>Elizabeth read the note over several times before
she quite took in its meaning, then she hurried to
a hollow tree, drew forth a small tin box and took
out a white flag. This she fastened to a long pole
hidden in the bushes and, lifting it, waved it slowly
back and forth. This was what the two girls called
running up the flag.</p>

<p>Betsy was on the watch, and as soon as she caught
sight of the waving banner she hurried down the
garden path, out the side gate, and in a few minutes
was in Elizabeth’s presence. She wore a black shawl
draped about her small person and a short veil
fell over her face. She could have taken no surer
way of appealing to Elizabeth than by such dress.
Arriving at the spot where Elizabeth waited, Betsy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
dropped upon her knees and stretched out her
arms in an attitude of despairing entreaty.</p>

<p>“Do not kneel to unworthy me, fair lady!”
began Elizabeth. “Rise and come to my heart.
Who am I that you should kneel to me?”</p>

<p>For answer, Betsy, still on her knees, moved
nearer and humbly kissed Elizabeth’s hand. “Your
gentle heart forgives a suffering culprit?” she
murmured.</p>

<p>“There is no question of forgiveness between the
Lady Phillipa and her adoring Frederica,” answered
Elizabeth. Then Betsy fell on her neck and the
two rapturously embraced. After which Elizabeth
held off her friend to look at her admiringly. “What
a fine costume,” she commented. “How did you
ever think of it?”</p>

<p>“I found the old black shawl up in the attic, and
the veil is one that aunt Emily had thrown away.
I cut off the holey part,” Betsy told her.</p>

<p>“It makes a perfect penitilential dress,” declared
Elizabeth. “But, Betsy, I am not going to take that
ribbon. I won’t, I won’t, I won’t. After your giving
me that lovely blue I would like to know who would
be the pig if I accepted both. Besides, you must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
have wanted it awfully yourself. Honest now,
didn’t you?”</p>

<p>Driven to a corner, Betsy had to acknowledge
facts. “Of course, or I wouldn’t have been so mean
about it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t call it mean. You have a perfect right to
it, a much better right than I have.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t that I haven’t the right, I suppose,”
replied Betsy gravely; “it is because I deceived you
and aunt Emily and allowed you to think I was
generous when I wasn’t. I wanted the ribbon to
make the thread and needle case much more than
I did anything to make a scent bag.”</p>

<p>“Well, but don’t you remember that you said it
would be no fair if I gave two presents and you only
one, unless yours should be much handsomer. Of
course we have to say that this is much handsomer,
so if you like it best why not let me make a scent bag
out of the blue flowery piece, a handkerchief case
out of something else, and you take this?”</p>

<p>“Would you really truly just as lief?” said Betsy,
still finding her ardent desire for the ribbon unquenched.</p>

<p>“Of course I would. I couldn’t possibly bring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
myself to gobble up the two very prettiest pieces
in the whole lot, and if I have one and you the other
that will make it just right, don’t you see?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Elizabeth, you are a dear, yet still I don’t
feel quite right about it.”</p>

<p>“You are supersensitive,” said Elizabeth, pleased
at being able to air a word which she had heard her
sister use that morning.</p>

<p>Betsy was a little awed by it, as she always was
by any addition to Elizabeth’s vocabulary. Elizabeth
always used new, important-sounding words
with such glibness and in such an assured manner,
though many times she did not get them just
right. “Aunt Emily likes the idea of the scent
bag,” said Betsy, a little uncertain yet.</p>

<p>“Then, I’ll tell you what,” said Elizabeth, ready
with an answering argument. “I promised you
some of my dried stuff in exchange for silk pieces,
didn’t I?”</p>

<p>Betsy was obliged to acknowledge this was true.</p>

<p>“Well, then, I wouldn’t be keeping my part of the
bargain unless I did it, so you take some and make
a scent bag for your aunt Em. I have another idea;
if you don’t like to use the pieces she is acquainted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
with you can get Kathie to change with you; she
has some real pretty ones, so Miss Emily will have
something quite a novelty to her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Elizabeth, what a very nice plan,” said Betsy,
now thoroughly convinced. “I do think you can
think out the nicest things. I should like to do that.”</p>

<p>“I almost hope next Saturday will be rainy,
don’t you?” said Elizabeth as, with arms around one
another, they walked towards the garden gate.</p>

<p>“I almost do,” agreed Betsy, “though I usually
despise rainy days. Come in and let us go up to
my room and look over the bag together; you
must have another choice, you know, and I will
choose something to swap with Kathie; you are
sure she will be willing to, Elizabeth.”</p>

<p>“Of course she will. It will be much more interesting
to have a variety.”</p>

<p>Betsy was satisfied with this assurance, and thus all
clouds rolled away.</p>

<p>It was too dark for Elizabeth to linger long, but
each made her choice from the stuffs which Betsy
shook out upon her bed, and then Elizabeth, with
hers safely tucked in her coat pocket, started up the
long street towards the brown house at the end of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>There was a comforting odor of supper when
Elizabeth entered, and she made straight for the
kitchen that she might discover what Electra was
cooking.</p>

<p>“Now, what are you after?” inquired Electra, as
she quickly shut the oven door.</p>

<p>“I wanted to know what it was that smelled so
good,” returned Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“I’ll be bound for you,” returned Electra. “It
is filoes for meddlers, if you must know.”</p>

<p>This was always Electra’s answer when she was
making something which she meant as a surprise,
and Elizabeth’s curiosity was aroused. She sniffed
the air, saying: “If I guess what it is will you tell
me?”</p>

<p>Electra smiled grimly. “I’ll give you three guesses,
and if you don’t guess right you can just clear out.”</p>

<p>“It has a sort of cakey smell, and yet it doesn’t
smell exactly like gingerbread,” said Elizabeth
contemplatively. “I suppose it isn’t ginger muffins.”</p>

<p>“If that’s a guess,” returned Electra, “I’m free
to say it ain’t.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think it was,” returned Elizabeth,
“so I am not going to call it a guess.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>“Then what was it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, just a—a sort of side remark.”</p>

<p>Electra laughed. “Hurry up, or I’ll shoo you out
without any guesses.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll guess rusk, hot rusks.”</p>

<p>“Wrong.”</p>

<p>“Then—then, maybe it is French rolls; I hope it
is, for I dearly like them.”</p>

<p>“You won’t have your appetite pampered by
them this night, although I don’t believe you’ll
refuse what is in the oven.”</p>

<p>“Let me see,” Elizabeth reflected. “I shall have
to think very hard for this is my last go.” She
looked around the kitchen. “It is not anything you
cut out, for you are not using the biscuit board.”
She went over to the sink where stood some dishes
which Electra had set there to wash. Elizabeth
regarded them earnestly. “That bowl looks as if
it might have had muffins stirred up in it,” remarked
Elizabeth, “though,” she added hastily, “that
isn’t a guess, ’Lectra.”</p>

<p>“It is just another side remark, I suppose,”
returned Electra.</p>

<p>Elizabeth opened the door of one of the cupboards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
and looked in. “It can’t be muffins,” she said, “for
there are the muffin pans.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, ain’t you smart?” declared Electra.
“Who but you would have thought of that? Now
turn your back and don’t peep while I’m looking
in the oven again.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth obeyed. “I can use my nose if I can’t
my eyes.” She made the remark sniffing thoughtfully.
“Oh, Electra, I believe I can guess with my
nose; it is Sally Lunn.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, ain’t you got a good nose; that’s
just what it is,” Electra told her. “We ain’t had
any in a long time, and as the bread had give out
with so much extra company over Sunday, I thought
I’d stir some up this morning. Being wash day, I
couldn’t do a regular baking.”</p>

<p>“I’m mighty glad you couldn’t, for Sally Lunn is
much better than bread or rolls or anything like that.
Is it most done, Electra?” Elizabeth peeped over the
woman’s shoulder as she tested the browning cakes.</p>

<p>“Not quite, but pretty near. You run in and get
me a plate while I take up this ham; then you can
sound the gong, for I reckon by the time they all
collect we shall be ready.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>Elizabeth ran off with alacrity. She enjoyed
helping Electra but was not always permitted to,
for Electra was cranky and as she had been with
the family a long time and was an excellent servant,
her peculiar moods were overlooked and the
children were not allowed to bother when she was
cross.</p>

<p>“Please let me take it in,” Elizabeth begged.
“Let’s wait till they are all at the table; it will be
so much more of a surprise that way.”</p>

<p>Electra was ready to humor her and allowed her
to bear in a well-piled plate in triumph, Elizabeth
announcing with an air of having planned the
whole thing “See, what a surprise I’ve brought.”</p>

<p>“Humph! You didn’t make it,” said Bert scornfully.</p>

<p>“I don’t care if I didn’t; I knew about it and that
is more than you did. Bah!” returned Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“Here, here, don’t let us have any squabbling,”
said Mr. Hollins. “That is not the sort of sauce we
want to season a good supper.” And the two children
subsided, being the more ready to do so since
they did not want to waste any time in beginning
their meal.</p>

<small><span class="smcap">The Themes</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ELIZABETH’S little sister Babs was singing
energetically as she played a pretended accompaniment
on the sofa:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Wild rose and Injun girl, bright alapaca,</div>
<div class="verse">Where sweeps the waters of the blue Jumiaca.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>She had caught this from Electra. She knew there
were wild roses and she had heard of alpaca; so she
put the words together as they sounded to her,
though they did not convey much meaning.</p>

<p>Elizabeth, in a big chair by the window, giggled.
Babs looked up indignantly and stopped her performance.
“What you laughing at?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I’m laughing at you,” replied Elizabeth; “you
are singing that in such a funny way.”</p>

<p>“I’m not at all,” contradicted Babs. “It is wild
rose and Injun girl and alpaca,—’Lectra knows.
She’s got a alpaca dress, too; she showed it to me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>Elizabeth for answer laughed the more, to Babs’s
great discomfiture. “What is it, then, if you know
so much?” she said.</p>

<p>“It is:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first2">‘Wild roved an Indian girl, bright Alfarata,</div>
<div class="verse">Where sweep the waters of the blue Juniata.’”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Babs pondered over this for a moment; it did not
seem half as intelligible to her as her own way of
singing it. “I’m going to ask ’Lectra,” she said,
finally, and flounced out of the room. Babs was a
tempestuous little body who flew into rages at small
provocation. She was much more practical than
Elizabeth and often showed her contempt for her
sister’s fancies. Her favorite doll was a very plain,
inartistic creature to whom was given the unlovely
name of Jim Dumps. Babs was seldom seen without
Jim Dumps in her arms, sitting by her side or
near enough to be spoken to and consulted upon any
subject. Babs always took him to bed with her and
he had his own seat in a small chair in the dining-room.
He did not wear big boy’s attire but was seen
in dresses to which was added a sacque, a shawl, a
scarf, or anything which happened to appeal to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
mood of his small mother. His face bore the marks
and ravages of time; he had been repainted more than
once, and was by no means beautiful, yet Babs loved
him with a faithfulness which was almost pathetic.
Mrs. Hollins had made the mistake upon the Christmas
before of substituting another doll of the same
size for battered-up Jim Dumps and had put him
out of the way in the furthest corner of a closet, telling
Babs he had gone away, and hoping she would
forget him in time. Babs tried to console herself
with the new doll, but one day, when she was playing
bear and the dark closet was her den, she rooted
out the old familiar body of her favorite and went
shrieking with delight to her mother.</p>

<p>“Muvver, muvver,” she cried, “what do you sink
I’ve found? My darling old Jim Dumps. He’s
comed back! He’s comed back!” And Mrs. Hollins
had not the heart ever to hide him again.</p>

<p>Elizabeth had not given up playing with dolls,
but her favorite was a lovely being named the Lady
Adelaide. She figured in many a romance, sometimes
reaching the dignity of a throne, and sometimes being
obliged to earn her living by singing in the streets.
Paper dolls, however, afforded Elizabeth more amusement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
and she was always eager for the first choice of
the colored plates in a fashion magazine. Over these
she and Babs had many a squabble, for Elizabeth
was still so much of a child as to consider these playthings
very important and could not see why she
should give up to Babs, so at last Mrs. Hollins had
to make the rule that Elizabeth was to have the pages
of one periodical and Babs the other.</p>

<p>After Babs had taken her departure from the room
where she had been singing “Bright Alfarata,”
Elizabeth returned to her book. Presently she gave
a long sigh which attracted her mother’s attention.</p>

<p>“What is it, daughter?” she asked. “That was
a very big sigh for a little girl.”</p>

<p>“I am thinking about my weekly theme,” returned
Elizabeth, “and I can’t make up my mind
which to write about—lynxes or daddy-long-legs.”</p>

<p>“Those seem to me rather queer subjects,” said
Mrs. Hollins, looking puzzled. “Did Miss Jewett
give them to you?”</p>

<p>“Oh no, I thought of them myself. She said
not to take any ordinary thing, like Spring or Happiness
or such to write subjects, but to try to be
original.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>“Just what do you mean by ‘to write subjects’?”
asked Mrs. Hollins.</p>

<p>“Why, subjects to write about, I suppose; that is
what Miss Jewett said: ‘to write subjects.’”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hollins laughed. “I suspect you haven’t
quite the right idea. There is such a word as trite.
You go and look it up in the dictionary and see if
you don’t think it is the word Miss Jewett used.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth obeyed, bringing the big dictionary and
opening it before her on the window-seat. She turned
over the pages, murmuring to herself, “t-o-t—t-r-a—t-r-i,—here
it is. ‘Trite, worn-out; stale; common.’
Of course that was what she meant. I’m glad
you explained it, mother. Lynxes or daddy-long-legs
wouldn’t be trite, would they?”</p>

<p>“Far from it! How did you happen to select them?
Do you know anything about either one?”</p>

<p>Elizabeth shook her head. “Not a thing, but I
am rather interested in them and I thought the best
way to learn about them would be to write about
them, for then I’d have to find out something.”</p>

<p>“That is one way of looking at it, certainly rather
an original one for a little girl. How do you happen
to be interested in these two creatures?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>“Why, you know Neal Paine shot a lynx down
by the woods back of the Paines’s house. I saw
it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember that he did and it made quite
a stir in the neighborhood. Some persons thought
it must have escaped from some travelling show and
others said it probably made its way down from
Canada, for they do not belong to these parts.”</p>

<p>“That’s what Betsy’s uncle said. He said they
used to be in the wild forests, but that as the country
was settled up they went further north, where it was
not so civilized. He thought this one might have a
mate. I shouldn’t like to meet it on a dark night,
should you, mother?”</p>

<p>“I must say I should not. What do you know
about the daddy-long-legs? It seems to me they
are funny things for you to take an interest in.
Most persons would be afraid of them.”</p>

<p>“I’m not afraid of anything but caterpillars and
creepy things, wormy ones. Betsy and I had a pet
daddy at her house. We used to feed it on gingerbread
crumbs and it would let itself down in the
middle and pick up the crumbs with its two
forepaws.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>Mrs. Hollins laughed. “I didn’t know daddies
had paws.”</p>

<p>“Well, whatever they are; those little short things
like claws that they use to pick up things with.”</p>

<p>“How did you become acquainted with your
daddy?”</p>

<p>“He used to come every day and gallop around the
round table in Betsy’s room. I think he liked the
bowl of nasturtiums she had there, for when he got
tired of galloping he would go and curl himself up
in the flowers.”</p>

<p>“What made you think it was always the same
creature?”</p>

<p>“Because he had a feeler gone. We think he lost
it in a fight, for one day we saw two daddies fighting
and they fought like anything. They have such
very, very thin legs and feelers, finer than thread, so
it would be very easy for an enemy to pull one off.”</p>

<p>“What became of your daddy?”</p>

<p>“He committed suicide,” answered Elizabeth with
perfect gravity.</p>

<p>“Why, Elizabeth, I do think that is going a little
too far. You are a little too imaginative when you
get started sometimes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>“But, mother, he really did. He walked right
into the open fire in Betsy’s room; we saw him do it.
We didn’t know whether he did it because he was
unhappy or because he thought it was a bright and
beautiful palace that he was going into; anyhow he
destroyed himself, for we saw him and we were too
late to pull him back from danger. We really missed
him very much.”</p>

<p>“Well, my dear, I think if you were to write just
what you have told me it would make a very good
theme and I wouldn’t bother about lynxes this time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I would like to. I might take the daddy
first and the lynx the next time, then I would have a
chance to learn more about lynxes. I really do want
to find out a little more about daddies, and I am
going to look them up in a encycellopedia.”</p>

<p>“Not quite so many syllables in that word,” cautioned
her mother. “It is encyclopædia. I think
the daddies belong to the spider family, and you can
probably find out about them in the volume which
has the article on spiders.”</p>

<p>“We called him Stilty,” Elizabeth informed her
mother, “because he looked just as if he were walking
on stilts.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>“That was a very good name,” agreed her mother.
“I think you have material enough for a very good
theme, so you’d better go ahead and write it while
it is fresh in your mind.”</p>

<p>“I must hunt up spiders in the encyclopædia first,”
said Elizabeth, and was soon poring over the article
she wanted.</p>

<p>She did not say anything to Betsy about her theme,
but to her great joy it was a success, for Miss Jewett
praised it before the whole school. “I am going to
read you the most original theme which has been
handed in,” she told her pupils. “I want you to see
how easy it is to find interesting subjects close at
hand. One doesn’t have to go to Europe to find
originality, doesn’t have to hunt in Africa to discover
something unfamiliar. You will all laugh when
I tell you this is the story of Stilty, a Daddy-long-legs,
and I can assure you I smiled when I read the
title, but it told me things I didn’t know and so I
am sure it will you.”</p>

<p>A snicker did go around the schoolroom, but the
title sounded promising and the children listened
with their best attention. Elizabeth sat with eyes
cast down, feeling very proud, yet a trifle embarrassed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
Never before had she been so honored as
to have a writing of hers read in public. No doubt
Miss Jewett did not want her to feel too much puffed
up, for when she had finished reading she said:
“Of course this is by no means a model theme, for
there are faults in spelling and punctuation, and you
would find a great deal to correct if you were to criticise
it. I commend it simply for its originality.”</p>

<p>When the paper was handed back to Elizabeth she
did find plenty of red pencil marks which called her
attention to mistakes, but she was quite exalted,
nevertheless, and Betsy was not long in making it
known that no one but Elizabeth could have written
the theme.</p>

<p>“Oh, Elizabeth,” she said, as they walked home together,
“I am so proud of you, and to think you
took our poor little Stilty and made such a fine story
of him. Why couldn’t I have thought of it? It
happened in my own room and I knew it just as well
as you, but I wasn’t smart enough to find out what
a good story it would make.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t quite sure whether it would be best to
take that or another subject,” Elizabeth told her,
“but when I told mother about Stilty she advised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
me to write about him, and now I am glad I
did.”</p>

<p>“What was the other?”</p>

<p>“I am not going to tell,” returned Elizabeth, “for
I may not use it after all.”</p>

<p>“I think you might tell me,” said Betsy coaxingly,
“then if you don’t use it I can.”</p>

<p>“If I don’t use it I will tell you,” replied Elizabeth,
and this was the most that Betsy could get her
to promise.</p>

<p>Whatever else the theme did it certainly started a
fancy for familiar subjects. For the next month or
two the gamut was run from crickets to turkey-gobblers,
so that when the lynx tale did appear it
did not make the sensation of Elizabeth’s first theme,
and, in fact, was not so good, as it did not relate
personal experience. Betsy wrote a funny story
about a toad; Bess presented a deadly uninteresting
and commonplace theme about a field-mouse, and
it became quite the fashion for the boys and girls
to watch the movements of insects, birds, and small
animals, so that if Elizabeth did nothing else, she
started up an interest in natural history and became
an unconscious influence for good, since the children<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
were much more ready than before to protect the
little creatures with whom they were beginning to
become acquainted.</p>

<p>To be sure the winter was setting in and there was
not much animal life to observe, but the very rarity
of it gave more interest. A cricket under the hearth,
a bird which had lingered longer than usual before
making its migration, a Molly Cottontail, a convocation
of crows, all these were noted and commented
upon. As the boys and girls came and went along
the country roads they were alert for any unusual
movement in the bushes or sound in the fields.</p>

<p>“What would you do if you met a wild beast?”
asked Bert, one day, as he and his sister trudged
home.</p>

<p>“I’d run,” replied Elizabeth laconically.</p>

<p>“Pooh! that wouldn’t do any good for it could
run faster than you could.”</p>

<p>“Then I’d climb a tree.”</p>

<p>“Suppose it could climb, too; lots of wild beasts
can, bears and panthers and wild-cats can.”</p>

<p>“They say if you turn and look a wild beast
straight in the eye it will turn and slink away,” said
Elizabeth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>“I wouldn’t like to try it,” returned Bert; “it
might pounce on you while you were getting ready,
and if it were dark it would not do any good.”</p>

<p>“Most wild beasts can see in the dark,” Elizabeth
made answer. “I read of a man once who met some
sort of wild beast and he couldn’t get away quickly
enough so he just leaned over and looked at it between
his legs; it scared the creature so that it ran
away, for it didn’t recognize the strange-looking
thing that was before it.”</p>

<p>“That was a good idea,” agreed Bert, at once beginning
to practice this feat. “I could do that, but
you couldn’t very well, because you have skirts on.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth admitted that this was a serious drawback
but thought if one always carried an umbrella
with a hideous face painted on and opened it suddenly
it might serve as good a purpose. “I believe
I will hunt up an old umbrella and paint a face on it,
or I could get Kathie to do it for me or Miss Jewett
could do it beautifully.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t do much good in the dark,” objected
Bert.</p>

<p>“If it were done with that shining sort of stuff
that they use for match safes and things it would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
very horrible,” declared Elizabeth. “I would always
carry it at night and one done with plain paint
in the daytime.”</p>

<p>Bert thought this might do very well for a girl.
“But I would carry a gun,” he declared; “then I
could shoot in a minute.”</p>

<p>“They used to do that way in old times when
there were Indians prowling about: they carried their
guns to church so if they were attacked by wolves
or Indians on the way they could defend their families,
but father wouldn’t let you carry a gun to
school, Bert.”</p>

<p>It was broad daylight and there did not appear to
be much necessity for such a precaution, so Bert
laughed. “I reckon I shan’t need one in this neighborhood,”
he said.</p>

<p>“You never know what may happen,” returned
Elizabeth, giving rein to her imagination.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small><span class="smcap">Scared</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FOR once Elizabeth’s imagination did not lead
her very far astray, as was shown a few days
later. She had mentioned the subject of the painted
umbrella to her sister Kathie but met with such
mocking laughter that she did not follow out her
intention of mentioning it to Miss Jewett, too.</p>

<p>“I declare, Elizabeth, you do have the craziest
ideas,” said Kathie. “One would suppose we lived
in the backwoods. Who ever heard of anyone’s
being attacked by wild animals around here?
There may be a fox or two away off in the far woods,
but that is all. You’re not afraid of cows, are you?
You’ll not meet anything worse on the road, I can
assure you.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth felt a trifle ashamed of her fancies but
answered, “Bess is afraid of cows and goats and
things with horns.”</p>

<p>“Well, you needn’t be,” replied Kathie. “This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
all comes of the wild stories you children have been
writing. I think you’d better stop it. You are
such a notional, emotional sort of child that you
are carried beyond all reason once you get started
on a subject. I think you had better let up on ‘Wild
Animals I Have Known.’”</p>

<p>“They weren’t all wild animals,” returned Elizabeth,
ready to argue; “only a very few were. Crickets
aren’t wild, are they?”</p>

<p>“Would you call them tame?” laughed Kathie.</p>

<p>“They don’t bite nor sting,” continued Elizabeth.
“Maybe you could call field-mice wild. Besides,
I don’t mean harmless wild animals, I mean fierce
things like wild-cats and bears.”</p>

<p>“One would suppose you were no older than Babs—to
be afraid of bears.” Kathie was scornful. “I
suppose you imagine one might scramble up the
stairs after you in the dark. You are like the baby
in the picture.”</p>

<p>To be called a baby, a great girl like herself, so
grown up as to have her theme read before a listening
public, was too much for Elizabeth and she
came to the conclusion that she was rather foolish
and that there would never be the slightest need for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
a face-painted umbrella. So she walked away and
gave up the idea.</p>

<p>It all came back to her that very evening, however,
for when she came home from school her mother
called her. “Elizabeth, I wonder if you couldn’t
take some milk down to Mrs. Traill’s. Her baby
is not well and their cow has gone dry, so I promised
her I would let her have some.”</p>

<p>“Can’t Bert take it?” said Elizabeth, having
other matters in mind.</p>

<p>“He is not here; your father sent him on an errand
as soon as he came in from school. It won’t take
you long and it isn’t dark yet. After this Mrs.
Traill will arrange to send for it, but she cannot
today. You would do that much for a little sick
baby, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>This reproof appealed to Elizabeth at once, so
without saying another word she picked up the tin
can her mother had set down for her and started
off. The way to Mrs. Traill’s was down a long hill
at the foot of which was a little bridge. Just beyond
this was Mrs. Traill’s small house. She was a poor
woman with two or three small children. She had
lately become a widow and was struggling hard to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
make both ends meet. Mrs. Hollins often employed
her and showed her many neighborly kindnesses.</p>

<p>Elizabeth did not mind the walk down hill, and
soon reached the house, giving her mother’s message
and taking pains to inquire after the baby. Receiving
the can back again after it was emptied,
the little girl started home, determining to stop just
beyond the bridge to gather some chestnuts which
she had seen on the ground under a big tree. She
had passed the bridge and was just about to creep
under the bars which led into the field when she saw
something which at first she mistook for a large
dog. She was not usually afraid of dogs but this
had an unfamiliar look so she backed away to
give it a second scrutiny. The creature advanced.
Elizabeth’s eyes grew bigger and bigger, then, shrieking,
she started up the hill, the animal, inside the
fence, loping along keeping pace with her. The
hill was long and steep, but the child flew along
panting, screaming, once in awhile casting fearful
looks at the beast which did not attempt to leap the
stone wall between them. All sorts of thoughts
flashed through Elizabeth’s mind. She wished for
the umbrella of her fancy; she wished that Bert was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
there with his gun; she wondered if she could scare
off the creature by a fixed gaze. This last took more
courage than she possessed, but she decided that she
must try to drive it off in some way as her breath was
giving out and she had still some distance to go
before the top of the hill and the turn in the road
should be reached. What could she do? Pausing
a second she hurled the empty can at her enemy
and, gathering energy for a final spurt, she fled
on.</p>

<p>Before this her cries had reached the ears of the
blacksmith whose shop was the first building at the
top of the hill. It was to him that Bert had been
sent on an errand, and he, too, heard the shrieks,
but had no idea it was his sister who was in trouble.</p>

<p>“Hallo, what’s the matter?” cried Jim Powers,
the blacksmith. “Why, Bert, it’s your sister,”
he exclaimed, and in another moment had raced to
meet the little girl, Bert not far behind him.</p>

<p>“Here, here, what’s the trouble, sissy?” said Jim,
kneeling down and putting his arm around the
frightened child. “There, don’t cry, tell us all about
it. Anybody hurt? What’s wrong?”</p>

<p>Having reached safety Elizabeth had only sobs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
for reply, but presently gathered voice to say,
“It’s there! It’s there! A great big terrible animal.”</p>

<p>“Where is it?” Jim asked.</p>

<p>“Down—down there in the field. It followed me
and I threw the can at it.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, I wouldn’t be scared,” said Jim soothingly;
“I reckon it isn’t anything worse than a dog.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but it is.” Elizabeth was regaining her
courage. “I thought it was a dog at first, but I
know it isn’t; I am sure it is a lynx.”</p>

<p>“By gum, you don’t say so,” returned Jim. “Run
home, Bert, and tell your father to bring his gun.
I haven’t mine at the shop and he’s the next nearest.
We’ll see to this.”</p>

<p>Bert did not need a second bidding but was off
like a shot, going full tilt up the road towards his
own house. He shouted out his news to those he
met on the way. “I say, there’s a big wild animal
down in the hollow by the bridge; we’re going to
shoot it.” We? Of course “we.” Should not the
prowess of the father be shared by the son?</p>

<p>By the time Mr. Hollins with his rifle and his
attendant squire, Bert, had arrived at the scene of
action quite a crowd had gathered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>Elizabeth and Jim Powers were first on the ground,
Elizabeth keeping very close to Jim and glancing
fearfully around; for up to this time the animal had
not been discovered. There was a great deal of
excited talk, much beating around in the bushes, and
some chaff.</p>

<p>“Don’t let it bite you, Bill,” said one big fellow
to another who was on his knees, looking under the
bars; and when Bill drew away his head suddenly
there was a shout of laughter.</p>

<p>“Where do you suppose he’s got to?” said Jim.
“How big was he, sissy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he looked awfully big; as big as a bear,”
Elizabeth told him.</p>

<p>“We’ll take a few inches off and allow him to be
as big as a calf,” responded Jim. “Have to make
allowance for your size and likewise for the size
of your scare.”</p>

<p>“Sure you saw anything at all?” queried the man
they called Bill.</p>

<p>“I should think I did,” returned Elizabeth, “when
it followed me almost to the top of the hill.”</p>

<p>Bert, who began to have doubts, since there was
nothing strange to be seen, felt a little ashamed at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
having brought the men there to no purpose and was
inclined to mock his sister. “I guess you dreamed
it,” he said. “I don’t believe there was anything at
all but a dog. It’s just like you, Elizabeth, to get
up an excitement all for nothing.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth began to wish that something to frighten
her brother really might appear. “I reckon if
you had seen what I did, and had been as near to
it you wouldn’t say it was imagination,” she said
indignantly.</p>

<p>“It could easy get away before this,” said Jim,
giving countenance to Elizabeth’s story.</p>

<p>“Where was it you saw it first, sis?” inquired Bill.</p>

<p>“Right here,” Elizabeth began. “I was going
to pick up some chestnuts—” She paused suddenly
and pointed with shaking finger to a wild appletree
overhanging the road. “There it is! There!
There!” she cried, her voice quavering with excitement.
“Oh run, run, Bert, it might spring on you,”—for
Bert was nearest to the tree.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be switched if she ain’t right,” cried
Jim, “for if there ain’t the blamed crittur up on that
there appletree.”</p>

<p>There was instant commotion, which proved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
that Elizabeth was justified in her fears, for, sure
enough, lying along a limb, switching its short tail
and gazing down at its enemies, was a great lynx,
a fearsome enough beast to alarm a less timid person
than Elizabeth.</p>

<p>There was the sudden sharp crack of a rifle, the
sound of a falling body, then a shout went up.
Elizabeth shut her eyes and held her hands tightly
over them. Scared as she had been, she was sorry
for the creature.</p>

<p>“You got him at the first shot,” cried Jim.
“My, ain’t he a whopping big fellow! As I said,
sissy, he is as big as a calf. You wasn’t so far out.”</p>

<p>“It is a lynx, true enough,” declared Mr. Hollins,
“although I cannot imagine how one could have
wandered down this way, so near to human habitations.”</p>

<p>“I said there’d be a mate when Neal Paine shot
that there other one back there in the woods awhile
ago,” said Jim Powers. “I surmised there’d be a
pair of them. I wouldn’t wonder if they got druv
out by forest fires and come ambling down this way.
There’s a good stretch of wild country up there in the
next county. These here critturs journeyed down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
from Canada, likely, though I’ve heard of a few
around in spots this side the border. I guess he
belongs to sissy, here, by right of discovery. What
you going to do with him, sis? Make a set of furs
out of him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” Elizabeth could not bear the idea.
Scared as she had been she was too tender-hearted
to think of wearing the skin of the animal which she
had just seen as a living, free, wild creature. “I
would much rather not,” she shook her head when
her father looked at her questioningly. “Why,
I was almost acquainted with him, father, and it
wouldn’t seem right to wear the skin of a person you
have known.”</p>

<p>The men shouted with laughter. “Well, if that
don’t beat all,” cried Jim Powers. “Skin of a person
you have known. I didn’t know lynxes was people.
I’ll have to tell my wife that.”</p>

<p>“I think we’d better have him stuffed and present
him to the State museum,” said Mr. Hollins. “He is
a fine specimen. See his short tail and the tufts of
hair on his ears. There is no doubt of his identity.”</p>

<p>It was quite dark by this time, and as Elizabeth
insisted that she was quite able to walk uphill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
again, she followed in the wake of the procession
which bore the body of the lynx to the blacksmith’s
shop. Bill Walker, having a lantern, led the way;
Jim Powers and Mr. Hollins bore the lynx on their
shoulders, Bert and Elizabeth brought up the rear.
In her excitement Elizabeth did not miss the effect
of this picturesque sight. “It looks like a scene in
a book,” she whispered to Bert. “Like those
hunting pictures when they bore home the trophies
of the chase.”</p>

<p>But Bert had no eye for the artistic, although
he did admire the spoils of the chase. “Gee, but
he’s got a pretty fur,” he said. “I’ll bet Kath
will speak for it.”</p>

<p>“She won’t get it, then,” retorted Elizabeth,
“for father is going to have it stuffed; he said so.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t mind having it to hang up in my den,”
returned Bert. “My, wouldn’t the fellows envy
me.”</p>

<p>“You won’t get it any more than Kathie. If
anyone has it Dick will.”</p>

<p>“Who says so?”</p>

<p>“I do. Jim said it belonged to me by right of
discovery.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>Bert had nothing to say to this, and they continued
their way to the blacksmith’s shop where the
body of the lynx was laid in state for the observation
and comment of the entire community.</p>

<p>Elizabeth’s first remark when, with her father
and Bert, she reached home, was in the nature of
an argument that was not to be gainsaid. “I told
you so, miss,” she exclaimed to her sister. “You
made fun of me for wanting to carry a scarifying umbrella;
I only wish I had had one this evening.”</p>

<p>“Why, did a cow run you?” inquired Kathie
flippantly.</p>

<p>“Nothing of the kind,” returned Elizabeth, on
her dignity, and feeling very sure of her position.
“I was attacked by a wild beast, a really, truly one.
You may believe it or not. Ask father if you
think I am making it up.” Elizabeth held her head
very high and felt that she had a perfect right to
assume an important air.</p>

<p>“What is she talking about, Herbert?” inquired
Mrs. Hollins. “And where have you all been?
Supper is ready and waiting.”</p>

<p>“She is pretty near the truth,” returned Mr. Hollins.
“I don’t know that she was exactly attacked,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
but she might have been; at any rate she was chased
by a lynx down there in the hollow by the bridge.”</p>

<p>“Why, father, is that really so?” cried Kathie,
looking at Elizabeth with new interest. “You
poor, little child, I expect you were nearly scared
to death.”</p>

<p>“How did you know it was a lynx?” asked Mrs.
Hollins, putting an arm around Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“Because I shot it,” he made answer.</p>

<p>“Yes, he did,” Bert chimed in, feeling that he was
not getting his share of the glory. “I ran and told
him and he came with his rifle and we all hunted
it up and there it was in a tree and father shot it.
Gee! but it was big. It’s down at the blacksmith’s
shop this very minute; you can see it there if you
want to.”</p>

<p>Then the whole story was gone over and Elizabeth
felt herself a great heroine, for she spared
none of the details of her horror and fright when she
was telling her part of the tale. In fact, she made it
so graphic that Babs was afraid to go to bed lest
a lynx or some other terrible beast should be in the
closet or should creep in by the window. Seeing
the effect of her story, Elizabeth tried to soothe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
her by telling her that angels with flaming swords
would be near by to destroy any evil things.</p>

<p>“But,” whimpered Babs, “I is afaid of ze angels,
too. I wiss zey wouldn’t have swords.”</p>

<p>So, as it fell to Elizabeth’s lot to put her little
sister to bed that night, she had to promise to stay
with her and see that there was nothing in or out
of the room to frighten her. “I will sing ‘Glory to
Thee, my God this night,’” she promised Babs. “I
always sing it to myself when I am afraid, especially
that verse that says ‘Let no ill dreams disturb my
rest nor powers of darkness me molest.’”</p>

<p>“Does that mean Jim Powers?” inquired Babs,
lifting her head.</p>

<p>“No, of course it doesn’t,” Elizabeth told her.
“It means things like mosquitoes and bats.”</p>

<p>Babs put down her head again and listened while
Elizabeth sang in her small childish voice. But the
hymn did not prove as convincing as Elizabeth
hoped, for when she had finished Babs lifted her
head again. “Is it all dead?” she asked. “Can’t
it walk?”</p>

<p>“Of course it is dead,” Elizabeth told her; “it
is as dead as a door-nail, although I don’t know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
why they say that. It can’t walk nor fly nor do
anything, and it is locked up in Jim Powers’s blacksmith
shop so it couldn’t get out if it wanted to.”</p>

<p>This assured Babs somewhat, but she could not
go to sleep till Elizabeth lay down by her and told her
a funny story about a wee, wee little fairy that lived
in a chestnut burr. She finally grew so sleepy in
the telling that she dropped off into slumber herself
and was not roused until her mother came up to
bed, when she was helped in undressing and cuddled
down at last, hearing drowsily her mother say:
“Good-night, dear little girl. Your mother is very
thankful she has you safe.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth half lifted her arm to give her mother
a hug, but it fell back again before she could raise
it to her mother’s neck, and the next thing she
knew it was broad daylight, the sun shining in her
window and Babs was tickling her to waken her up.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small><span class="smcap">Winter Doings</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS the heroine of such an adventure, Elizabeth
was the admiration and envy of the whole
school while Bert was a close second. Being at the
boastful age, Bert was not slow in discoursing upon
how “we” did thus and so; “We” chased the lynx—“We”
shot him—“We” carried him to Jim Powers’s
shop. “Yes, sir, I tell you he came mighty near to
springing on me,” was his greatest boast.</p>

<p>As for Elizabeth, she bore herself more modestly,
but nevertheless was willing to tell of her experience
with all the thrilling details she could think of while
the boys and girls gathered around in breathless
attention.</p>

<p>Big Phil Selden, who had never taken the least
notice of Elizabeth, secretly placed a huge red apple
on her desk. Leonora Stayman offered her a ring
set with a blue stone. Maria Black asked if she
couldn’t walk home with her. As these were all two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
or three years older than Elizabeth and counted her
among the little girls, she considered herself much
complimented.</p>

<p>The mild weather suddenly gave place to a sharp
frost, which was followed by the first snow, and Elizabeth
became much in demand for coasting. Not a
boy that was not willing to drag her uphill for the
sake of coasting down again in her company; not a
girl who would not have done the same if Elizabeth
had allowed it. This did all very well for awhile,
but finally she grew tired of having honor thrust upon
her and, moreover, found that however popular she
might be with the boys she was losing favor with the
girls; even her own Betsy and Bess once or twice
walked home without her. Elizabeth was quick-tempered
upon sudden provocation, but was long-suffering
where her friends were concerned, so she
did not resent these slights until she overheard Bess
say: “Humph! I suppose we’re not old enough for
her to care for. Well, let her go with the big girls if
she wants to!”</p>

<p>“You’d better say boys,” replied Betsy. “She
went down on Phil Selden’s sled three times yesterday
afternoon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>“Some people are too lazy to pull their own sleds
uphill,” returned Bess.</p>

<p>Elizabeth, in the cloakroom, heard it all. She
flounced out, her cheeks blazing and her eyes snapping.
“You mean, deceitful, jealous things!” she
cried. “I heard every word you said, and I don’t
want to speak to you. I am going to ask Miss
Jewett to let me change my seat, Betsy Tyson, and
as for you, Bess Ferguson—no wonder the boys don’t
want to drag a great fat thing like you uphill. I’ll
never, never be friends with you again, so there!”
She flounced out the door and down the path before
the schoolhouse, pounding her feet down very hard
and trying to keep back the smarting tears.</p>

<p>Betsy and Bess looked at one another dismayed.
“Now we’ve done it,” said Betsy. “You needn’t
have called her lazy, Bess. You know she isn’t.”</p>

<p>“That wasn’t half as bad as what you said,” returned
Bess, aggrieved.</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t really mean it,” returned Betsy.
“I didn’t know she was in there, did you?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I didn’t. I wouldn’t have had her hear
for the world.”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose she will ever forgive us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>“I am not at all sure that I want to forgive her.
I think what she said was a great deal worse than
what we did.”</p>

<p>“You <i>are</i> fat, you know,” replied Betsy, ready to
be a little spiteful.</p>

<p>“I’d rather be nice and plump than be a little
skinny thing like you,” returned Bess.</p>

<p>Betsy curled her lip scornfully. “Oh yes, we’re
very well pleased with ourselves, aren’t we? Wait
till you have to do your arithmetic alone and you
won’t be so pleased at having quarrelled with
Elizabeth.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” replied Bess with an air of supreme
indifference. “I’m not the only one who did the
quarreling; you were as bad as I.”</p>

<p>“You began it.”</p>

<p>“But I only said things about girls and you said
about boys; that was a great deal worse.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean it; I was mad,” Betsy repeated.</p>

<p>Bess was not ready to acknowledge that much.
Elizabeth’s remarks still rankled and as anything
relating to her personal appearance was a tender
subject with Bess she could not forget very soon.
“I’m not going to apologize, are you?” she said.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
“She ought to apologize first. If she doesn’t, I’ll
take you for my first best friend, Betsy.”</p>

<p>“Indeed you won’t, then,” returned Betsy. “If
I can’t have Elizabeth I don’t want anybody.”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well,” responded Bess with a haughty
air. “Nobody wants you, I’m sure.” And she walked
off, leaving Betsy torn by varied emotions.</p>

<p>For two whole days the three girls did not speak
to one another. Each went her own way. Betsy
moped by herself. Bess selected Flo Harris as a
companion. Elizabeth sought out the older girls,
and it must be said that, in defiance, she was more
friendly than usual with the boys.</p>

<p>Then appeared upon the scene Corinne Barker, a
city girl, who dressed stylishly and accepted attentions
with the air of one conferring a great favor.
Her parents had gone abroad and she was to spend
the months of their absence with her aunt and uncle.
She was a little older than Bess though somewhat
younger than Leonora Stayman and Maria Black.
Bess was ready to make overtures at once. Corinne’s
real coral necklace, her flashing ring which far outshone
Elizabeth’s modest little turquoise, her gold
bangle, all these won Bess’s admiration, and it must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
be said that there were others who looked with envious
eyes at these possessions. In imitation of
Corinne, Bess changed the style of wearing her hair
and presented herself with her usually smooth locks
pulled down in scraggy loops over her forehead and
bound down with a fillet. It was not becoming,
but Bess prided herself upon its being in the latest
style. Within the next twenty-four hours nearly
every girl had followed the new fashion. Betsy arose
early, had breakfast before her aunt and uncle and
so escaped detection. Miss Emily would never have
approved, Betsy well knew. When she took her
place by Elizabeth’s side, her desk-mate gave her
an amused, supercilious glance which did not escape
Corinne’s eye. Elizabeth, be it said, had made up
her mind not to ape the new pupil, for she had taken
a dislike to her from the first. Corinne, recognizing
in Elizabeth a leader, was ready to make war against
her, and so matters stood after the second day of
Corinne’s coming.</p>

<p>Betsy had begun to make overtures to her first
best. She well knew her aunt would not permit her
to adopt the new fashion of arranging her hair and
she also knew it was far from becoming. Betsy’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
little dark face, overshadowed by her dusky locks,
looked like some small animal’s; still she wanted to
prove that she could follow the style if she wanted
to. Not only little girls, but the world in general,
will take pattern after a flock of sheep; let one jump
over a fence, the rest will jump after it. Betsy had
made the jump to show that she could, but she was
ready to return to her familiar field, the more especially
as she missed the companionship of Elizabeth.</p>

<p>At recess a flock of girls gathered around Corinne
to examine her corals, to borrow her ring for a moment,
to see how it would look on another hand, to
hear her recount the number of parties and teas
which she had attended. The schoolhouse porch was
by no means deserted that day, for Corinne preferred
it to any outside spot. Elizabeth with her older
friends sat on a bench by the gate, a row of boys
perched like crows on the fence above them. Betsy
uncertainly hovered between the two places.</p>

<p>“Come here, Betsy,” called Corinne. “See if my
ring will fit your third finger; it is too small for Bess.
Flo says it will be too big for you, but I don’t believe
it. I know my hand is smaller than yours.”</p>

<p>Betsy paused in taking a second bite of her big<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
red apple, and looked uncertainly toward the group
by the fence.</p>

<p>“Your hair looks real nice,” continued Corinne.
“Bess says she didn’t believe you would dare to
change it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it looks very nice,” replied Betsy
doubtfully; “I just tried it for today to see how it
would look. I am going back to the old way tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t,” Corinne went on. “It mightn’t
look nice if you had red hair like some people we
know. Nobody can be good-looking with red hair,
and they must always expect to be made fun of.”
This was spoken quite nonchalantly and with a
little laugh.</p>

<p>Then all Betsy’s loyalty arose. She knew how
sensitive Elizabeth was about her auburn locks, and
that she had heard every word Corinne said, as it was
intended she should. “Real red hair, of course,”
responded Betsy. “But there is nothing in the world
so beautiful as auburn hair. True auburn hair is
very rare, my uncle says. All the artists rave over
it, and anyone who has it doesn’t have to wear it
like common folks.” Then, having flung forth her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
defiance, Betsy turned and ran to where Elizabeth
sat on the end of the bench, snuggling up close to her,
putting her hand in hers, and whispering, “I just hate
that Corinne Barker. I wish she had stayed at
home.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth gave the little hand a squeeze and Maria
Black remarked, “I think Elizabeth Hollins has the
prettiest hair I ever saw. I am glad she has sense
enough to wear it as she does. I wish you could
have heard my brother make fun of me this morning.
I almost was ashamed to be seen after what he said
about my hair. I’ll not dare to wear it so another
day, I can tell you.” As Maria was the oldest girl
in school her words carried weight and Elizabeth
looked at her with grateful eyes.</p>

<p>So peace was once more restored between Elizabeth
and Betsy. But Bess still hung off; she could
not forget that Elizabeth had called her fat, but she
was soon almost the only one who sought out Corinne.
The older girls avoided her, the boys would
have nothing to do with her. Boys despise a girl
who makes mean little pin-pricking remarks about
other girls. When they have a grievance they fight
it out with their fists and have done with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>Miss Jewett had noticed the coolness between
Betsy and Elizabeth and was sorry. These two were
her favorite pupils although she tried not to show partiality.
As she was some day to marry Betsy’s uncle,
Mr. Robert Tyson, she often discussed her scholars
with him. “I wonder what is wrong between Elizabeth
and Betsy,” she said to him one evening. “Has
Betsy confided in you?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t had any report,” returned Mr. Tyson.
“They sometimes have these little flare-ups, but
they don’t last.”</p>

<p>“I believe all girls do have them,” said Miss
Jewett reflectively. “It seems to go with youthful
friendships. Perhaps the charm of making up makes
them more ready to quarrel. This time it seems
rather serious. I notice the two have scarcely spoken
to one another for two whole days, though they sit
side by side.”</p>

<p>“That does look serious. What about Bess Ferguson?
Which side does she take?”</p>

<p>“Oh, she has gone over entirely to the new element.
I have Mrs. Wilmer’s niece, Corinne Barker,
you know, and she has made quite a sensation.”</p>

<p>“In what way?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>“Rather a silly way. I don’t like her influence
with my sweet, simple girls. She is putting wrong
notions in their heads and is stirring up discord, I
am afraid. Of course, one must expect girls to admire
trinkets, but I don’t think it is good taste for
them to put them on when they come to school.
This Corinne Barker enjoys nothing so much as
making a display and is the envy of the whole school.
She wears her hair in an abominable fashion which
I was amused today to see imitated by nearly every
girl in school. Even Betsy came with frowsy locks
pulled down over her pretty low forehead. It
gave her an uncanny look for she has such a mite of
a face that it seemed to leave her with only half
enough.”</p>

<p>“I’ll venture to say aunt Em didn’t observe it,”
returned Mr. Tyson with a little laugh. “I must
look tomorrow morning and see for myself.”</p>

<p>But there was nothing wrong with Betsy when her
uncle next saw her, for her hair was arranged in its
usual neat fashion and she appeared in good spirits.
“Isn’t aunt Emily down yet?” she inquired as she
came into the breakfast-room where her uncle was
looking over the morning paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>“Not yet, but we needn’t wait. You can begin on
your orange if you like.”</p>

<p>Betsy seated herself and her uncle put down
his paper. “What is the matter with you and
Elizabeth?” he asked. “I hear you are at odds
again.”</p>

<p>“Who told you? We are not, whoever it was,”
Betsy replied.</p>

<p>“But weren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes,” Betsy answered hesitatingly; “we
were for a little while.”</p>

<p>“How did it happen?”</p>

<p>“Well, she overheard something Bess and I were
saying and she pounced out at us and got awfully
mad and called us mean, jealous, horrid things. Then
she said Bess was fat and that we were both deceitful,
so—” Betsy paused.</p>

<p>“So,”—repeated her uncle,—“there was a big
row. What made her say you were all those
things? Were you?”</p>

<p>Betsy looked down at her plate. “I believe we
were a little.”</p>

<p>“What were you saying about her?”</p>

<p>Betsy was honest and did not hesitate to tell.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
“Bess said she was lazy and I said she liked to play
with the boys better than with us girls.”</p>

<p>“Was it true?”</p>

<p>“Why, you see everybody made a lot of her after
her adventure with the lynx and of course she liked it.
Phil Selden has the very nicest sled in school and he
took her on it ever and ever so many times, then
Maria Black made a fuss over her and Leonora Stayman
gave her a ring that was too small for herself
and—and——”</p>

<p>“You and Bess were jealous, I see. So that much
was true, and you said things to one another behind
her back that you wouldn’t have said to her face. I
suppose we might call that deceitful.”</p>

<p>Betsy nodded in token that she thought this true.
“And Bess is fat,” she declared.</p>

<p>Mr. Tyson repressed a smile. “While no one can
say truthfully that Elizabeth is lazy. It looks to me
as if you had the worst of it, Betsy. The court convicts
you on your own evidence and condemns you
to pay Miss Elizabeth Hollins ten kisses in return
for her injured feelings.”</p>

<p>“I’ve already paid them,” returned Betsy gravely.
“We made up today after Corinne Barker called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
her a red-head. I wouldn’t stand that, you know; so
I said what I thought and I am never going to have
anything to do with her, with Corinne, I mean.”</p>

<p>“Not even to the extent of adopting her manner of
wearing her hair,” said Mr. Tyson slyly.</p>

<p>“Oh, uncle Rob, did Miss Jewett tell you? Of
course she must have. It was silly, of course, but I
just wanted to see how it looked.”</p>

<p>“Did you find out?”</p>

<p>“It didn’t look nice a bit. Elizabeth told me on
her sacred honor that I was a sight, though that
isn’t the reason I gave it up, at least it isn’t the only
reason. We have formed ourselves into two parties,
Styles and Non-styles. Elizabeth and I belong to
the Non-styles, so do Maria and Leonora. Bess
belongs to the Styles, but we don’t care.”</p>

<p>“I must say that I approve more heartily of the
Non-styles myself,” Mr. Tyson told her. “But here
comes your aunt Em. I’ll not tell, Betsy”—a promise
which Betsy was glad to hear.</p>

<small><span class="smcap">Bess Gives a Party</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CHRISTMAS came. Betsy and Elizabeth presented
their gifts to Miss Jewett upon the last
day of school before the holidays began. Miss Jewett’s
desk showed a great stack of gifts, the most
showy being a sofa pillow from Corinne Barker and
the most appreciated being those which Elizabeth
and Betsy had made themselves. Elizabeth spent
much thought upon the composition of a proper
set of verses to go with the scent bag, and finally
produced the following:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I gathered from our garden beds</div>
<div class="verse">These simple herbs for you,</div>
<div class="verse">For they are sweet and you are sweet,</div>
<div class="verse">I’m telling what is true.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I fain would be dried as they</div>
<div class="verse">If I might dwell within</div>
<div class="verse">Your handkerchiefs and laces gay</div>
<div class="verse">You fasten with a pin.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
<div class="verse">Whene’er you ope your bureau drawer</div>
<div class="verse">And smell this bag I send,</div>
<div class="verse">I pray you think of one who signs</div>
<div class="verse">Herself, your loving friend.</div>
<div class="indent2">Herbs are not pollens.</div>
<div class="indent2">Elizabeth Hollins.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>There were tears in Miss Jewett’s eyes as well as
laughter on her lips when she read this effusion.
“The dear, ridiculous child,” she murmured,
“she is so preciously funny.”</p>

<p>It had taken Elizabeth a long time to find anything
to rhyme with Hollins and she felt very triumphant
when she discovered the word pollen, though
plural it has none. Elizabeth, however, never let
a little thing of that kind appall her and often took
such poetic license as would have amazed a greater
poet. She did not show her rhymes to anyone, not
even to Betsy, for she had a romantic feeling that
the more secret the more tender. She wrote the
verses, in her best manner, on the back of a Christmas
card showing an angel with a violin. She had commissioned
her brother Dick to get this for her.
To his credit be it told, that he took much trouble
and only after searching long and faithfully did he
find what she wanted and sent it to her. To say
that Elizabeth was pleased only half expresses it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
Her letter of thanks to Dick was characteristic.
She said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Dick</span>,—I am abnormally obliged to you for
taking the trouble to send me the enchanting card. It is
exactly what I wanted and is memoriably lovely. What
it is to have a brother!</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright3">I remain, my dear sir,</span><br>
<span class="indentright2">Yours gratefully,</span><br>
<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>Dick had a good laugh over the letter and put it
away among those he treasured. “It will amuse
her some day when she has grown up,” he told
himself.</p>

<p>Miss Jewett was trying to help Elizabeth in her
use of words but there had not been time as yet to
show much result from her teaching. On the day
that school closed for the holidays Bess announced
importantly that she was going to give a party on
New Year’s night. She had not returned to her allegiance
but showed both Betsy and Elizabeth that
she vastly preferred Corinne to either of them. They,
therefore, wondered if an invitation to this festivity
would be given them.</p>

<p>“It would be dreadful to be left out,” declared
Elizabeth as she and Betsy were talking it over.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
“It would be almost a disgrace, for she will invite
nearly everybody in the school, except the very little
children, of course.”</p>

<p>“She won’t have a very big party if she is going
to invite only those who are friends with Corinne,”
returned Betsy caustically. “We’ve known her
all our lives and our families are friends and all that.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it will be as her mother and grandmother
say, anyhow,”—Elizabeth took some comfort
in this.</p>

<p>“And I’d like to see Mrs. Lynde offend my aunt
Emily; she wouldn’t do it, for they are very intimate
friends. I shall tell her about the party right
away and of course she will expect that I am to go.”</p>

<p>So much for Betsy’s prospects. Elizabeth was
not so sure of her own. Bess had painted her
plans in vivid colors, her ambition being to give
such an affair as should be equal to those described
by Corinne. Musicians discoursing sweet strains
of music behind a screen of palms, a supper ordered
from a caterer in the city, party dresses made to
order for the occasion, sounded very grand to little
girls used only to very simple affairs. “I suppose
If I do go,” said Elizabeth, “I couldn’t have a real<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
party dress; I would just have to wear my best
white.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I should, too. Aunt Emily doesn’t
approve of little girls like us having real dressy
clothes.”</p>

<p>“I heard Bess say that her dress was to be blue
chiffon over blue silk with tiny pink rosebuds on it.
Won’t it be beautiful?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose so,” returned Betsy carelessly.
“I reckon she will enjoy it more than anyone else.
If you wear white, Elizabeth, I will wear it, too,
so we can keep each other company. We will not
be the only ones, either, for I don’t suppose half the
girls will have really truly party dresses.”</p>

<p>“Have you heard what Corinne is going to wear?”
asked Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“White lace over pink, I believe; at least that is
what Flo Harris told me.”</p>

<p>This promised to be very fine attire, thought Elizabeth,
yet she was comforted by what Betsy had
said—that not half the girls would have real party
dresses and would go in whatever might be the most
appropriate thing they had.</p>

<p>The next day saw Corinne and Bess driving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
around town in a pony-cart delivering the invitations.
Corinne had spoken her mind when they first
started forth. “If you are going to invite that red-headed
Elizabeth Hollins you can count me out,”
she said.</p>

<p>“Oh, but Corinne, I have to,” replied Bess.
“Grandmother and mamma made out the list and
her name was one of the first. I really have nothing
to do with it, you see.”</p>

<p>“We’ll manage some way,” declared Corinne.
“Just you leave it to me. She lives so far out that
we will have to leave it till the last, anyway, and
I doubt if we get through in time to go there, so
we can take it to the post-office.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but,—” began Bess, slightly disturbed, yet
not exactly seeing how mailing an invitation would
prevent its reaching its destination.</p>

<p>“Now see here,” continued Corinne, “which would
you rather would come to the party, Elizabeth or I?”</p>

<p>Bess remembered the lace-over-pink frock which
would add glory to her entertainment and promptly
replied: “You, of course.”</p>

<p>“Then if you want me you can’t have her. I’m
not going to see her sailing around and being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
made so much of. What do you suppose she will
wear, Bess?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose she wouldn’t get a new dress for
the occasion. She will wear her best white, I
suppose.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” Corinne gave a scornful exclamation.
“Now listen. We will go to the post-office
with her invitation; when we get inside you hand
her invitation to me and I’ll do the rest. You can
say you took it yourself to the post-office, can’t
you? That will be the strict truth; you don’t
have to know what happens after that.”</p>

<p>Bess had an idea of what would happen and felt
very reluctant to hand over the invitation to Corinne,
so she was silent.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to do it?” asked Corinne.
“I suppose you will like her going around telling
everybody that you are too fat to look well in
your lovely new frock.”</p>

<p>This was rather a back-handed way of putting
it, but Bess did not perceive that; she only saw
that the glory of her attire might be undervalued;
and so she gave in, at the same time feeling conscience-stricken
and more unhappy as time went on.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
At the post-office she gave the envelope into Corinne’s
hands, turned her back and asked no questions.
“Now then,” said Corinne as they came out, “if
anyone asks you all you have to say is that you took
the invitation to the post-office yourself, and it will
be perfectly true.”</p>

<p>Betsy promptly reported to her first best that she
had received her invitation, that her aunt Emily
said she was to go and could wear her white mull.
“Which of your white frocks are you going to wear,
Elizabeth?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose I shall wear any of them,”
returned Elizabeth, in a subdued voice. “I haven’t
been invited.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Elizabeth, I don’t believe it. I saw Corinne
and Bess driving old Fan around in the pony-cart
yesterday. Perhaps they didn’t have time to come
out here and you will get yours today.”</p>

<p>This was an encouraging possibility; but as day
after day went by and no invitation came Elizabeth
was fain to believe that she had been left
out.</p>

<p>“I’m just going to ask,” said Betsy indignantly.
“I don’t see how they dared not ask you. I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
going to ask Mrs. Lynde myself why you weren’t
invited.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, please don’t, Betsy. I wouldn’t for the
world have them think I cared.” Elizabeth had
pride in the matter.</p>

<p>“Well, I shall find out some way.” Betsy was determined.
“If you don’t go I shall stay away, and
if aunt Emily asks me why, I am going to up and
tell her.”</p>

<p>This was loyalty beyond expectation. To deliberately
absent one’s self from a party such as this
promised to be showed great strength of mind,
thought Elizabeth. “I don’t want you to do that,”
she said. “I want you to go and then tell me all
about it. I didn’t really think that Bess was keeping
on being so very very mad with me,” she added.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it is Bess at all; I believe it is all
that horrid Corinne Barker.”</p>

<p>“But she didn’t make out the list. I heard Bess
say, myself, that her grandmother and mother were
doing it.”</p>

<p>“You never know,” returned Betsy.</p>

<p>But as the days passed by there was no solution
of the mystery. Christmas came and went and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
the fact of having no party in anticipation did not
in the least interfere with Elizabeth’s enjoyment
of the day. Darling Miss Jewett had given her a
beautiful copy of “Little Women” and had added
a photograph of herself in a pretty frame. As
Elizabeth had heretofore depended upon borrowing
from Betsy when she wanted to read anything of
Miss Alcott’s, this first contribution towards a set
of the much-prized books gave intense delight. As
for the photograph, it was kissed rapturously and
at the first opportunity Elizabeth hastened off to
the giver to express her thanks.</p>

<p>After greetings and thanks were over Miss Jewett
said: “And now I suppose the next excitement is
the party Bess is going to give.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth’s face fell. “I suppose it will be very
exciting to those who are going,” she answered
sadly.</p>

<p>“Why, but surely you are going. Is there any
reason why you should not?” asked Miss Jewett.
She did not know what cause might keep Elizabeth
at home, although she knew Mrs. Hollins
was not liable to deprive her little daughter of this
pleasure without good reason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>“There is a very good reason,” Elizabeth told
her: “I am not invited.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but Elizabeth, there must be some mistake.
I saw the list myself, and I can vouch for your name
being on it. I am sure I saw it. Neither Mrs.
Lynde nor Mrs. Ferguson would be so unkind as to
leave you out. There must be some mistake.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe there is,” said Elizabeth, “for
Bess and Corinne took around the invitations themselves,
and Bess would know. She couldn’t forget
me even if she isn’t friends any more.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you friends? I didn’t know it was as
bad as that.”</p>

<p>“I’m friends, but Bess isn’t,” said Elizabeth.
“She hasn’t been since she became such chums with
Corinne.”</p>

<p>Miss Jewett was thoughtful for a moment, then
she repeated: “There must be some mistake. I
still think so. I wouldn’t feel badly, Elizabeth,
until we really discover what is the matter.”</p>

<p>It was not till two days before the date of the party
that Miss Jewett had an opportunity of asking
any questions. She spent part of her holidays with
her own family and did not return until the morning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
of the thirtieth. On the train she met Mrs. Ferguson
who had been to the city to make some necessary
purchases for the entertainment, and the two chatted
together until they reached Brookdale.</p>

<p>In discussing the different girls Mrs. Ferguson
spoke of Elizabeth in such a manner as to lead Miss
Jewett to believe that she was expected to be one of
the guests.</p>

<p>“Bess is very particular that we should consider
this a most formal affair,” said Mrs. Ferguson,
“and is quite put out when any of those invited
fail to write a note of acceptance; but I tell her it
is too much to expect all that from the little girls
who do not know grown-up ways, and she must
take it for granted that all will come whether they
say so or not.”</p>

<p>“Who are those who have failed to be so formal as
Bess requires?” asked Miss Jewett.</p>

<p>“Elizabeth Hollins, for one, but she and Bess
have always been so intimate that there is no need
for her to write. Bess has not mentioned her case,
but did become quite miffed because Flo Harris only
called across the street: ‘I’m coming, Bess.’ ‘That
isn’t the way young ladies in the city would do,’ Bess
said to me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>“I think I can tell you why Elizabeth has not
answered,” returned Miss Jewett; “she never received
her invitation. I know her well enough to
be sure that nothing would please her so much as to
write a most formal and highly-flown note, and
besides she told me herself on Christmas Day that
she was not going to the party because she had not
been invited.”</p>

<p>“Dear me,” returned Mrs. Ferguson; “that is
most unfortunate. I would not hurt the dear
child’s feelings for the world. I must see to the
matter as soon as I get home.”</p>

<p>She lost no time in doing this but put the question
to Bess almost as soon as she reached home. “Bess,”
she said, “I have just heard that Elizabeth Hollins
failed to get her invitation to your party. You
must go out there this very afternoon and tell her,
or, better still, I will write an invitation in proper
form so she will not feel slighted. I don’t see how
it happened that she did not get one. I am sure
that she was not overlooked, for I looked over the
envelopes myself before I put them in the basket.”</p>

<p>“Did you give it to Elizabeth herself?” asked
Mrs. Lynde.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>“No, grandmamma,” Bess replied. “I took it
to the post-office. It was so late when we got
through that Corinne said we’d better take it to
the post-office.”</p>

<p>“As long as that was the furthest point you had
to go you should have gone there first,” said Mrs.
Lynde, “and have left the places nearer home till
the last. It is too bad, but evidently it has gone
astray.”</p>

<p>Bess said never a word though she was really
relieved that Elizabeth would have her invitation
after all. She would not say a word to Corinne
about it, and when she came to the party and found
Elizabeth there she would surely not go away.</p>

<p>But it happened that it was not Bess who took the
invitation for she was in demand by the dressmaker
that afternoon and could not be spared, so Mrs.
Ferguson hastily wrote a note and ran in to see
if Betsy would be so good as to take it with the invitation
to Elizabeth. Would Betsy refuse? Of
course not. She went on wings of joy and burst
in upon Elizabeth in great excitement. “It’s here,
it’s here,” she cried. “It was a mistake, after all.
They did send it and you didn’t get it. Read the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
note.” She thrust the envelopes into Elizabeth’s
hand and stood by panting from the haste with
which she had come.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was not long in understanding the contents
of the note. “Joy! Joy!” she cried. “Mother,
Kath, it’s come! It was a mistake after all. I
can go! I can go!”</p>

<p>“What in the world is this all about?” asked
Kathie, coming in from the next room, followed by
her mother.</p>

<p>“The party,” answered Elizabeth. “I can go,
for they did send me an invitation and I never got
it at all. Oh, I am so glad. Shall I wear my white
dress or my organdy?”</p>

<p>“We will look them over and see,” promised her
mother.</p>

<p>“We’d better be quick about it then; there is
only one more day in case there is anything to be
done to make a dress ready,” said Kathie. And
Elizabeth flew to the attic to bring down her summer
store of frocks.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small><span class="smcap">In Despair</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS Elizabeth tossed the pile of summer frocks
on the lounge her mother took them up one
by one and examined them. Finally she selected
two and said: “These seem to be in the best condition,
but it has been several months since you wore
them and you have grown, Elizabeth. You’d
better try them on and if they are all right I will
get Electra to press out one of them.”</p>

<p>Off went Elizabeth’s frock, Betsy’s nimble fingers
helping her to unfasten it. “Try the white one
first,” suggested Betsy.</p>

<p>Elizabeth slipped it on, then looked down at her
arms and legs which seemed to have shot out suddenly
like a telescope. “Oh dear, it is much too
short in the sleeves and skirt,” she exclaimed. “I
didn’t know I had grown so much.”</p>

<p>“You remember that you did not wear this
many times last summer, for you were laid up with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
those eyes of yours,” said her mother. “One
can grow a good deal in six months. Try the other
one, daughter. Perhaps it will be better.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth tried on the next selection, a pretty
little organdy with tiny bunches of flowers over it.
She liked this frock very much and hoped it would
do. But, alas, it was as bad as the other, and Elizabeth’s
face fell. “I can never wear them, can I,
mother? What shall I do? I have nothing but
winter frocks and they will look so funny. I’d
almost rather not go than wear a woollen frock
when all the other girls will have on light ones.”</p>

<p>Kathie had taken up the white frock and was
examining it. “It would be very little trouble to
change these into elbow sleeves if there were any
way of lengthening the skirt. It has already been
faced, I see. I suppose you haven’t a piece of
embroidery or insertion that could be put on.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth’s face brightened as she listened to the
suggestions. It seemed a very easy matter to make
the alterations, she thought.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Hollins shook her head. “I am afraid
I have not a scrap of anything that would do and
it is too late to send to town for anything. I use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
up materials very closely, and what Elizabeth
outgrows we make over for Babs, you know. Let
us see what can be done with the organdy.”</p>

<p>Kathie began overlooking the frock. “It hasn’t
been faced,” she said, “but I am afraid it has faded
and would show where it was let down. I will measure
the other skirts and see if there are any longer
than these or that have not been faced.”</p>

<p>However, it appeared that there was nothing
any more promising. Elizabeth’s wardrobe had
not been added to very liberally the summer past
as she was housed the greater part of it. Seeing
the state of things, the tears gathered in the child’s
eyes. “I can’t go, I can’t go,” she wailed. “Oh,
fate is cruel, cruel! To hold this beautiful prospect
before me and then to snatch it away. I was resigned
to staying at home till I got the invitation,
but now it is much more bitter.”</p>

<p>“My dear child,” begged her mother, “don’t
take it so tragically. We will try to contrive something.
If we only had a little more time we could
make over something, I am sure, but with only
one day, I am afraid we couldn’t. I wish I had more
of that white material, Kathie; it might do to piece<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
on a hem; it could be done neatly, or could be joined
with lace or something of that kind. I am sure I
have no more of the stuff, for I remember I used
the last scrap for the sleeves. Suppose you look
through your things and see what there is; you might
find something that could be ripped from one of
your frocks and could be used.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth lifted her head from the pillow where
she had buried it, and felt somewhat heartened.
“Would you have time to alter it, mother, if Kathie
does find anything?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I think so,” said her mother cheerfully.
“We will make time. There is the rest of this afternoon
and evening, and all day tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“But tomorrow is New Year’s; I’d hate to
have you sew all day on New Year’s Day,” said
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“I might be doing something worse,” replied her
mother with a smile. “Don’t worry over that,
my dear. If we can find anything to eke out I
shall be only too glad to do the sewing and Kathie
can help.”</p>

<p>Presently Kathie returned with some things hanging
over her arm. “I am afraid there is nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
among my things that will match the lace on the
waist,” she said, “but we can see.” Then followed
an attempt at matching, much discussion and suggestion,
but finally one after another garment was
discarded. Kathie sat with knitted brows, pinching
her lips and turning over the remainder of
Elizabeth’s frocks. The least attractive frock seemed
the only possible one; it was a plain little dimity
which nobody regarded with much favor.</p>

<p>“I’m in despair,” said Elizabeth plaintively.
“I hate not to look as nice as the others.”</p>

<p>“I hate it, too,” said her mother, “but I do not
see anything else to do.”</p>

<p>“I will lend you my gold beads,” said Kathie
comfortingly, “and I will look among my ribbons
to see if I can find anything that will do for your
hair. I wish you had some pretty slippers and
stockings; they would add a great deal.”</p>

<p>“I have white stockings, and those white canvas
slippers. I suppose they will have to do.”</p>

<p>“I will clean the shoes,” Kathie offered, “and
they will not look badly.”</p>

<p>She picked up the dimity frock and began to
rip out the hem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>Elizabeth watched her with anything but enthusiasm.
It did seem hard luck that the very
prettiest of her frocks must be the one that she
could not wear. Presently Kathie threw down her
work and went out of the room. Just then Miss
Jewett was announced. “I could not rest till I
learned whether you had your invitation to the party,
Elizabeth,” she said, “I found out this morning
from Mrs. Ferguson that by all rights you should
have had it and I hoped she had sent it.”</p>

<p>“She did send it right away, by Betsy,” Elizabeth
told her. “Did you have a good time, Miss
Jewett? I am so glad you have come back.”</p>

<p>“I believe I am glad to get back,” replied Miss
Jewett with a smile. “Of course I was glad to be
with my people and to see my friends, but I never
did care for a big city and after being here all this
time it seemed more unattractive than ever. But,
Elizabeth, you don’t seem to be very enthusiastic
about the party.”</p>

<p>“I am enthusiastic about the party,” answered
she, “but I am far, far from enthusiastic about my
frock. Isn’t it a cruel misfortune, Miss Jewett,
that I have grown so that all my summer clothes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
are too small for me. Only one, poor, mean little
dimity can be made to do. I wouldn’t care so much
if this were not so very, very grand a party and all
the fine dressing there will make me appear a poor
Cinderella indeed.”</p>

<p>Miss Jewett laughed. “But you must remember
that Cinderella had perfectly gorgeous clothes for the
party; her fairy godmother saw to that, you know.”</p>

<p>“But, alas, I have no fairy godmother,” returned
Elizabeth. “I must confess, Miss Jewett,” she
whispered, “that I shouldn’t care so much if it were
not for Corinne. I know she will nudge the others
and look me up and down in that supersillyous
way she has.”</p>

<p>There was mirth in Miss Jewett’s eyes as she
asked: “How do you spell supercilious, Elizabeth?”</p>

<p>“S-u, su, p-e-r, per, s-i-l-l-y, silly, o-u-s, ous,”
replied Elizabeth promptly.</p>

<p>“Before I tell you whether that is right or wrong
I would like to know what is your idea of the meaning
of the word,” said Miss Jewett.</p>

<p>“Super means above, or more than,” Elizabeth
answered, “so I should think it meant more than
silly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>Miss Jewett threw back her head and laughed
heartily. “Oh, Elizabeth, I might know you would
have some original way of getting at it. Your dictionary
will tell you that it is derived from a Latin
word which means lifting an eyebrow.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, that is just the way Corinne does,”
returned Elizabeth with satisfaction. “She lifts her
eyebrows in that haughty way and makes you feel
so—so,——”</p>

<p>“Like slapping her,” put in Betsy.</p>

<p>“That is just what you do feel like,” agreed
Elizabeth. “I should enjoy the party much more
if she were not going to be there.”</p>

<p>“Well, there is one thing you may be sure of,”
said Miss Jewett confidently; “you will enjoy it
much more than she will, for all her fine clothes.”</p>

<p>“How can you tell that, Miss Jewett?” asked
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“The kingdom of heaven is within you,” quoted
Miss Jewett with a smile. “I don’t believe you will
mind, once you get into the good time, whether you
have on a plain frock or not. Why, the best time
I ever had at a party was when I wore my street
dress. It was in the country and my trunk somehow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
went astray, so I had to make the best of it, though
everyone else had on something appropriate.”</p>

<p>This was consoling information to Elizabeth,
yet the thought of the blue chiffon and the lace-over-pink
costumes still troubled her. “Betsy
has a lovely white mull,” she told Miss Jewett.</p>

<p>But just as she spoke Kathie entered. She greeted
Miss Jewett cordially and in a few minutes bore her
off to her room, from which Elizabeth and Betsy were
excluded. Miss Jewett was very fond of Kathie
and though she was several years older she enjoyed
Kathie’s society more than that of any other girl in
the village. Kathie admired and liked Miss Jewett
immensely and the two had many good times together.
Probably one reason for their intimacy
lay in the fact that Miss Jewett was engaged to
Betsy’s uncle, while Kathie and Betsy’s brother,
Hal, hoped some day to marry.</p>

<p>“I do wish Elizabeth did have something more
suitable,” declared Kathie, as she set to work upon
the dimity skirt. “She usually doesn’t care much
about having a special dress, but this is supposed
to be such a very grand affair and she has heard the
other girls talk so much about it that somehow she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
feels a little sensitive, and no wonder. If the invitation
had only come in time we could have sent
to the city for material to make a new frock.”</p>

<p>“It is too bad,” returned Miss Jewett. “I don’t
blame the child in the least for feeling a little dissatisfied;
even an older person would be justified
in doing so. I suppose you have nothing you could
make over for her, Kathie?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I have, but there is not time enough.
The party comes off tomorrow night, you know.
I am perfectly willing to sew every minute, but I
am afraid to promise, for it would be worse to disappoint
her than to have her wear the dimity.”</p>

<p>“What did you think of making over for her?
I wish you would let me see,” said Miss Jewett.</p>

<p>Kathie went to her clothes-press and brought out
a yellow silk muslin. It had little satiny dots upon
it and was very pretty. “I thought of this,” she said.
“It is quite impossible for me as it is. There is a
big spot on the front of the skirt where one of the
boys spilt ice-cream, but there is plenty in it to
make an entire frock for Elizabeth.”</p>

<p>“It would just suit her, too,” Miss Jewett declared.
“And I have some reddish-brown velvet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
which would make lovely bows for her hair. Oh,
Kathie, I wish you would let me help you make it
as a surprise for her. I tell you what you do; take
all the measurements and bring the stuff down to
our house tomorrow morning. Auntie will be
delighted to have us use her machine. We can get
some of the other girls to come if your mother
cannot, and we will rush it through. Now, not
another word; it has got to be done. I have set
my heart on it. I’ll stay this evening, if you say
so, and we can get it started. Oh, there will not
be the slightest difficulty in finishing it, I am
sure.”</p>

<p>“You dear thing!” cried Kathie. “That would
be perfectly lovely. We will not say a word to
Elizabeth till it is all ready. I can see her delight.”</p>

<p>“She will look just like a bright nasturtium,”
Miss Jewett went on. “I wish she had shoes and
stockings the color of the velvet.”</p>

<p>“She has only white ones that would do.”</p>

<p>“Then I will tell you what we can do; we can dye
the stockings, Auntie will attend to that; she is a
great hand at dyeing, and I will paint the shoes.
I have plenty of colors and I know I can do it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>“You are a positive genius,” exclaimed Kathie.
“I must go and tell mother; she will be so
pleased.”</p>

<p>“Shall I commence to rip up the yellow frock
while you are gone?” asked Miss Jewett, determined
that no time should be lost.</p>

<p>“It is too dark, I am afraid, but I will bring a
light at once.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hollins was highly pleased at the secret,
and the two friends began at once upon the task.
Elizabeth and Betsy were denied admittance and
the next morning Kathie started off early to Miss
Dunbar’s, carrying materials in a suit-case and providing
herself with all necessary measurements as
well as with one of Elizabeth’s frocks for a guide.
She remained away all day, calling up her mother
on the telephone once in awhile to report progress,
in order that Mrs. Hollins might know whether her
help would be needed.</p>

<p>About dark Elizabeth heard her sister’s and Miss
Jewett’s voices in the hall below. “It’s all ready,
Elizabeth,” called Kathie cheerily. “Go into my
room and we’ll help you dress. Bring your things
in there. We are going right up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>“I can’t find my shoes and stockings,” came word
over the balusters presently.</p>

<p>“Oh, can’t you?” Kathie made answer. “Never
mind. I took the shoes, you know. I’ll get them
when I come. I do want you to see what a darling
little frock we have made,” she said in a subdued
voice to her mother, as she hastily opened the suit-case
and brought forth the yellow silk muslin.
“I suppose she will have to know at once because
she will have to see the shoes and stockings. Look
at these dear velvet bows, mother. Won’t they
look fine on the child’s auburn head. Mattie
Paine is going to send over a yellow fan she has,
and I am going to lend my beads, the gold ones.
Coming, Elizabeth!”</p>

<p>Cutting short her mother’s exclamations of admiration
and pleasure, Kathie hastily put the
frock back and ran upstairs, Miss Jewett and Mrs.
Hollins following, all three being eager to see how
Elizabeth would take her surprise.</p>

<p>“We shall want more light than this,” decided
Kathie, as she entered the room lighted by only a
small lamp. “I’ll go get the big lamp from mother’s
room, Elizabeth.” She hurried out, leaving Elizabeth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
standing in the middle of the floor, dressed up
to the point of petticoats but wearing her bedroom
slippers. “You can take off that extra petticoat;
you won’t need it,” remarked Kathie, setting down
the lamp and lifting the suit-case to a chair.</p>

<p>“Why won’t I need it?” inquired Elizabeth.
“I always wear two with thin frocks in winter.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, do as I tell you,” commanded
Kathie, fumbling at the fastening of the suit-case.
“Here are your shoes and stockings,” she continued
with a little laugh, handing them to her sister.</p>

<p>“Why, why,—” began Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hollins and Miss Jewett stood by smiling
at her. Kathie shook out the yellow frock. “Here
is your costume, Miss Elizabeth,” said Kathie.
“It has changed color since last night, hasn’t it?”</p>

<p>Elizabeth looked with astonishment growing
into delight as Kathie held up the frock. Then she
gave one squeal of excitement and threw herself
prone on the bed, from which she immediately raised
herself to say: “Oh, what a delirious dream of
delight! I have a fairy godmother after all.”</p>

<p>“You seem to have had several of them,” returned
her mother, “and they have been working like Trojans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
for you all day. They gave your own mother
no chance to lend a hand.”</p>

<p>The yellow frock went on over a soft silk slip of
the same color, made from Kathie’s; the shoes and
stockings were pronounced “Too fine for anything!”
the bows were adjusted upon the curling auburn
locks, the gold beads were fastened around the slim
little neck and Elizabeth stood arrayed. It was a
simple little costume, with elbow sleeves and round
neck, very slightly cut out, but Elizabeth envied
no one. Let who would wear blue chiffon and lace
over pink—she did not care; and she went off with
such a radiant face as repaid those who had spent
New Year’s Day working for her.</p>

<p>With her brother Dick as escort and well wrapped
up for the cold walk, Elizabeth fared forth gayly.
At the gate of the Lynde house they met Betsy and
Hal. The house looked very festive, brightly illuminated
as it was. The door was flung open with a
flourish by an obsequious individual, a nephew of
aunt Darkey’s who had come up from the city to
serve upon this occasion. “Ladies’ room to de right;
gemmans’ to de lef,” he announced, much as if he were
calling off the figures in a dance; and the two little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
girls excitedly went up, turning their heads to notice
the decorations, the odor of flowers and the subdued
strains of music. It was all their fancy painted it.
“If only Corinne were different,” was Elizabeth’s
only regret.</p>

<p>Betsy had been let into the secret of Elizabeth’s
dress, but clung to her white mull as being quite
nice enough. She looked very dainty and sweet and
was as appreciative as Elizabeth could wish when
the wonderful frock was displayed to her. They went
downstairs together and on to the drawing-room
where stood Bess in all the magnificence of blue
chiffon and pink rosebuds. Several guests had
arrived and these stood in little groups, rather shy
and awkward as yet. Elizabeth and Betsy made
their greetings and then looked around the room.
Corinne was not there. “Probably she preferred to
be fashionably late,” conjectured Elizabeth. “Corinne
hasn’t come yet,” she ventured to Bess.</p>

<p>For a moment Bess was possessed by mixed feelings,
part relief part shame. No one knew; no one would
ever know why Elizabeth’s invitation had failed
to reach her at the proper time. Bess had no idea
of telling. She looked at Elizabeth, really quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
pleased to see her appearing so happy and so well
dressed. After all there were no friends like old
friends. Elizabeth would be sure to do her share in
making the party a success. She was always the life
of a company. “I am awfully glad you could come,
Elizabeth,” she said, with her old-time cordiality.
“Corinne has the mumps; she can’t come.”</p>

<p>And so the last unpleasant element passed out of
Elizabeth’s anticipations. It was a fine party. She
enjoyed it to the extent of her ability, which was
great. Betsy, too, had almost as good a time. Bess
enjoyed it to the measure of her capacity, which Dick
said was as a half-pint measure to a gallon, when he
was comparing the fulness of his sister’s joy with
that of the rest.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE party over and holidays past, there was
nothing to look forward to but a long stretch
of school-days, cold mornings and colder nights. It
was generally too cold in the attic for Elizabeth to
seek that retreat so she and Betsy preferred the
latter’s warm room where, if they played quietly,
they were allowed entire freedom. Paper dolls were
much in favor these times and their adventures as
set afoot by Elizabeth would fill a book.</p>

<p>At school matters went on quietly, although there
were days when Elizabeth longed for excitement.
Corinne having duly recovered from her mumps,
“on both sides,” took her place again. She was
much chagrined at having to forego the party and did
not like to have Bess talk about it. As it was the
favorite topic of this young person she and Corinne
became less intimate. Elizabeth had given unstinted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
praise to the great entertainment, had told Bess she
looked perfectly lovely in her blue frock and had
said many other nice things; therefore Bess was
glad to be again considered second best and conveniently
forgot about her share in withholding
Elizabeth’s invitation. The easiest way out was
always the rule Bess abided by, and as long as things
in the present went smoothly she did not bother
about either past or future.</p>

<p>It was one cold day in January that Elizabeth
found her excitement. If she could have foreseen
the nature of it she would not have been so anxious
to stir up the humdrum routine, but she did not
foresee. Neither did Bert. This youngster was as
full of mischief as any boy of his age is liable to be,
and his chief aider and abetter was Patsy McGonigle.
What one did not think of the other did. It was
not that they disliked their teacher or that they
wanted to annoy her, but it was so deadly dull with
nothing but lessons, and sitting still was so very
hard for restless creatures like themselves that if
they could break the monotony by causing a little
ripple of mirth they did not see why anyone should
object so very much.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>It was with some such thought in mind that Bert
began his day. On the way to school he had captured
a little field-mouse. He did not mean to hurt
it, and did not know exactly what he meant to do
with it, but first of all he must provide a cage for it,
so he took his lunch from the tin box in which he
carried it, punched a few holes through the bottom
of it with a nail, popped Mr. Mouse inside, and there
he was safe and secure. The luncheon was wrapped
up in a piece of paper and Bert proceeded to school.
Once or twice he slipped a few crumbs inside the box
so that the mouse might not feel himself utterly
neglected, and would realize that he had a friend at
hand. The rest of the time the box rested in Bert’s
desk. There came a moment, however, when the
spirit of mischief whispered in Bert’s ear: “Why
don’t you have a little fun? What’s the use of living
if you can’t have fun?” Bert listened to the voice
of the charmer. Why not have some fun? If he
let the mouse out, slyly, of course, no one would
imagine he had anything to do with it, and it would
be such sport to see the girls all jumping about and
climbing up on chairs. Even Miss Jewett would be
scared; it would be so funny to see her. Now was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
the propitious moment, for Miss Jewett was putting
some work on the board, the room was quiet, everyone
was busy. Bert opened his desk a little way and
put his hand in. He gently lifted the lid from the
box and shut his desk quickly, then he appeared to
be applying himself diligently to his books. In a
few minutes he quietly opened his desk a few inches
and presently the mouse peeped forth.</p>

<p>Just what made Elizabeth turn her head at the
critical moment it would be difficult to tell, but she
did so just in time to see the mouse come forth and
to see Bert’s eyes full of laughter. She knew Bert
well enough to understand what had happened. For
a second she gazed with fascinated eyes at the little
creature creeping along the desk. Chilled by its stay
in the tin box, it moved slowly and Elizabeth was as
quick as a wink. She started up, threw her handkerchief
over the mouse, grabbed it and thrust it into
her desk without creating much confusion. Even
Bert did not know that she had seen him open his
desk to let it out. The girls and boys behind her
began to giggle. Some of them saw what she did
but they had not quite understood. Others thought
it was a make-believe mouse which she had brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
to school to amuse herself and the rest. Some
thought she had taken something of her own away
from Bert, but no one knew his part in the performance,
or had any idea that her whole purpose was
to save Bert from discovery and the school from an
uproar. It was a most exciting situation and Elizabeth
rather enjoyed it. She could hear the mouse
running around inside her desk and she slipped a
pencil under the lid that he might have air. Betsy
was all alert and looked at her inquiringly. Elizabeth
suppressed a giggle. She was not in the least
afraid of mice and rather admired the long ears and
big eyes of the little field-mice. She would like to
make a pet of this one, but it would probably be
better to let it go free she decided.</p>

<p>Betsy continued to look from Elizabeth to her
desk with an inquiring expression. Finally she could
stand it no longer and wrote on her slate. “What
is it?”</p>

<p>By the same means Elizabeth wrote her answer:
“Mouse.” Then both began to giggle and a titter
ran around the rows of boys and girls behind them.</p>

<p>Miss Jewett looked around sharply. “What is
the matter?” she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>The faces all sobered down. Lessons appeared to
be the sole interest. Miss Jewett returned to her
work on the board.</p>

<p>As soon as her back was turned all eyes were bent
with interest upon Elizabeth’s desk. Nothing happened
and the eyes went back to the books. Presently
Elizabeth discovered that she needed a book
from her desk. How could she get it? What was
she to do when other books were needed? She began
to see difficulties before her. Why she did not have
the courage to walk up to Miss Jewett and say,
“Miss Jewett, there is a mouse in my desk,” it is
hard to say. It would have been the easiest way out
of the dilemma. At all events she did not do it, but
by movements and signs let Betsy understand that
she wanted the loan of her dictionary.</p>

<p>Those in the rear began to comprehend the situation
more clearly and the tittering recommenced.
Just as Betsy was making the transfer Miss Jewett
turned and saw who was the central figure of interest.
She determined to find out what Elizabeth was doing,
for she was evidently amusing the school in some
way. Down the aisle walked Miss Jewett and stood
at Elizabeth’s desk as she received Betsy’s book into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
her hands. “Haven’t you a dictionary of your own,
Elizabeth?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Jewett,” was the prompt reply.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you use it, then? Did you leave it at
home?”</p>

<p>“No, Miss Jewett.”</p>

<p>“Where is it? Have you lent it?”</p>

<p>“No, Miss Jewett, I haven’t lent it.”</p>

<p>“Then if you have it why don’t you use it? Has
anything happened to it?”</p>

<p>“No, Miss Jewett.” Elizabeth was becoming
confused.</p>

<p>Miss Jewett glanced down at the desk and saw
that it was a crack open. The mouse by this time
had settled down comfortably and was making no
stir; yet Miss Jewett felt that something was not exactly
right. “Open your desk and get out your book,
Elizabeth,” said Miss Jewett in a matter-of-fact way.
“Don’t let us have any more talk about it.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth’s face turned scarlet but she made no
movement to obey, she only murmured, “I can’t,”
hanging her head as she spoke. Why didn’t she say
more? Why didn’t she say: I can’t, because there
is a mouse in my desk and I don’t want it to scare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
you and the school? Who knows why she did not?
It was certainly very stupid of her not to, but then
very bright girls can be very stupid sometimes.</p>

<p>The teacher waited for the space of a minute; then
she lifted the lid of the desk and out sprang the
mouse. Miss Jewett gave a small shriek and fled
to the platform. The girls all gave louder shrieks
and jumped up on their chairs, at least most of them
did; some of the boys did too. Others began to chase
the mouse who was running wildly from corner to
corner.</p>

<p>In a moment or two Miss Jewett had regained her
self-possession. “Open the door, boys, and it will
find its way out,” she said. “Sit down, girls. It
was rather startling, I admit; but there is nothing
to be afraid of.”</p>

<p>Phil Selden opened the outer door and the mouse
found its way to freedom. In a few minutes the
school settled down again to peace and quiet, but
Elizabeth felt most uncomfortable. She thought of
what she might have said and what she did not. She
knew that Miss Jewett had a right to feel annoyed
and to blame her for what had happened, but she
did not see how she, herself, could explain matters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
now that the mischief was done. There was no
explanation, she realized, and so she must suffer.</p>

<p>As no one had been blamed, Bert congratulated
himself that both he and his sister would be let off
scot-free; and at the close of the session he went out
with the rest, saying to himself that it had been good
fun and he was glad it came out as it did. Elizabeth
had no such easy mind. She did not want to discuss
the subject with the rest of the girls so she
lingered behind and let them all depart ahead of
her.</p>

<p>Miss Jewett stood at the door watching the children
leave. As Elizabeth and Betsy came along she
said, “Wait a moment, Elizabeth; I want to speak
to you.” She spoke pleasantly, but she looked grave
when Elizabeth came to her. Betsy went on ahead,
saying that she would wait outside.</p>

<p>Miss Jewett sat down at her desk and pulled up a
chair for Elizabeth. For a moment neither spoke.
Miss Jewett settled some papers, then, leaning on
her elbows with her chin in her hands, she looked at
the child before her. “Elizabeth,” she said, “will
you tell me what made you behave so badly this
morning? It isn’t like you to try to make mischief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
in school and all that. I have always counted upon
you and Betsy. What spirit of evil possessed you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Miss Jewett,” replied Elizabeth
in a subdued voice.</p>

<p>“Did you know that mouse was in your desk?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Jewett.”</p>

<p>“And that was why you didn’t open it when I
told you? I must confess it was a pretty good reason,
but I can’t see why you didn’t tell me it was there.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth couldn’t see, either, except that the
mouse had not entered of its own accord.</p>

<p>“You couldn’t have put it there, of course. You
couldn’t have done that,” continued Miss Jewett,
half questioningly; but Elizabeth made no reply.
Miss Jewett looked distressed. “I can scarcely believe
you would wilfully do that,” she went on.
“Did you, Elizabeth?” she said, after a pause long
enough to permit Elizabeth to reply. Still no answer
came. “Did you?” repeated Miss Jewett a
little more decidedly.</p>

<p>“I am afraid I did,” Elizabeth finally replied in so
low a voice that her teacher could scarcely hear her.</p>

<p>Miss Jewett’s face fell. She sat looking at Elizabeth’s
downcast face which had all the expression of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
one in the wrong. After a few minutes of silence
Miss Jewett arose. “We’d better not say any more
about this now,” she said. “I am so grieved and
disappointed that I don’t know exactly what to say.
I want to think it over, and I want you to think it
over. Perhaps you can give me some explanation
after awhile. Of course, Elizabeth, one looks for an
apology for a thing of this kind, but I would rather
wait till tomorrow, after school. You may go now.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth walked out, the tears running down her
cheeks. It was the first time she had left Miss Jewett’s
adored presence in such a manner. There had
always been a loving kiss and a gay good-bye.
What had possessed her not to explain, but to sit
there and let all this wrong construction be put
upon her actions? She hardly knew. She only felt
that Miss Jewett should have known her better
than to believe that she had planned such mischief.
Appearances were against her and by some strange
contrariness she had not been able to prevent it.
She would not tell on Bert, that was certain; she
had never been a tattler and she was not going to
begin now. She walked home, being glad that Betsy
had gone on ahead and that she was so late as not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
to encounter any of the other girls. When she
reached home she went straight to her own room
and threw herself down on the bed to have her cry
out. After a little while Babs came trudging up the
stairs. She paused a moment at the door before she
called, “Lizabef, is you comin’ down to dinner?”</p>

<p>“I don’t want any,” returned Elizabeth from
within.</p>

<p>Another pause while Babs considered this. “Muvver
says you’d better come and get you dinner!”
came the second call.</p>

<p>“Tell mother I have a headache and don’t want
any dinner,” was the reply.</p>

<p>Babs went off murmuring to herself: “Has a
headache; doesn’t want any dinner.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth spoke truly, for by the time her mother
came up she was flushed and feverish and her head
ached badly. Mrs. Hollins asked no questions, but
drew down the shades and dropped a light kiss on
the child’s hot cheek. “Try to go to sleep, dear,”
she said. “I will send word by Bert that you will
not be at school this afternoon.” Elizabeth was
usually so eager to go that her mother knew there
was no pretence in this excuse of a headache.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>In the darkened room where all was quiet Elizabeth
finally did fall asleep, and when she awoke life
did not appear quite so dreary to her. She even
thought of writing a touching appeal in verse to Miss
Jewett and composed the first two lines in her mind,
then she decided that this was not the occasion for
anything of the kind. She had been wrong and yet
she had not been wrong. The next day after school
she would explain in a very dignified manner and
then if Miss Jewett still demanded an apology she
would see. She had been misjudged and—well, no,
she had not been condemned exactly. Miss Jewett
had said she must think it over. She had given her
a chance to make an explanation, certainly she had.
Why, she had been very patient and kind when you
came to think of it. Of course nobody would like to
be made ridiculous before the whole school and it
was very mortifying to be made to jump and scream
in that way. In her calmer judgment Elizabeth saw
all this and was really quite cheerful when she at
last made up her mind to trust to the morrow to
smooth out the tangle. “I suppose,” said the little
girl to herself, “if she had kissed me as she always
does I wouldn’t have been so sure that she was angry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
with me. I got all worked up over that and thought
it was much worse than it is.” So she arose from
her bed, washed away the traces of tears, discovered
that she was very hungry and when the summons
to supper came, was ready to respond with the
greatest alacrity.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS Elizabeth entered the dining-room someone
jumped out from behind the door and pounced
upon her. “Why, Betsy,” cried Elizabeth, “when
did you come?”</p>

<p>“Just now,” returned Betsy. “I came with Hal.
He is going to take supper with you all, for he and
Kathie are going somewhere afterward. I asked
aunt Em if I couldn’t come too, and she said I might
if I would not stay long afterward. Hal and Kathie
promised to take me to our gate when they go down.
I was so worried about you, Elizabeth, when you
didn’t come to school. Bert said you had a headache
and I was afraid you were getting some fatal disease.”</p>

<p>“I did have a headache,” Elizabeth acknowledged,
“but it is better now. I think when I have had some
supper I shall feel all right. I thought supper was
ready.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>“I think they are waiting for your father to come
in,” Betsy told her. “Elizabeth, I am so anxious
to know what Miss Jewett had to say to you.”</p>

<p>“She didn’t have very much to say,” replied Elizabeth
doubtfully. “She thinks I put the mouse in
my desk on purpose to be mischievous, and she was
very much hurt, so was I.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Elizabeth, were you really? You did put
the mouse there, you know.”</p>

<p>“But I didn’t do it to make fun; I did it so it
would not upset the school and scare Miss Jewett.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell her so?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; somehow I couldn’t. I got sort
of rattled, I think; at first I did, and then I was mad
because she thought I did it on purpose so I just
wouldn’t say.”</p>

<p>Betsy was thoughtful for a moment. “I wonder
how the mouse got in,” she said. “I never saw one
in the schoolhouse before, did you? Where was it
when you picked it up, Elizabeth?”</p>

<p>“It was running along the top of a—a desk. It
must have been cold or something, for it didn’t run
fast and didn’t seem a bit afraid. I put my handkerchief
over it and picked it up quite easily.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>“You are going to school tomorrow, of course,”
said Betsy.</p>

<p>“Oh yes.”</p>

<p>“And you will tell Miss Jewett that you didn’t
kick up a fuss on purpose.”</p>

<p>“Maybe so,”—Elizabeth still had a remnant of
hurt feelings. “She may not believe me if I do tell
her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Elizabeth, she must. She wouldn’t be so
mean. When you love her so much I don’t see how
you can think she could be so mean.”</p>

<p>“She loved me so much and yet she thought I
could be mean,” replied Elizabeth, still on the defensive.
“I was hurt to the very core of my being,
Betsy, and there is no balm for my wounded heart.”</p>

<p>Just here the family appeared and the conversation
ceased. Betsy was quite at home here, and was
never treated as company. She now began taking
some things from a chair that she might draw it up
to the table. As she removed some books, Bert’s
lunch box clattered to the floor. Betsy picked it
up and saw that there were queer holes in the bottom
and that a cooky, which looked as if a mouse
had nibbled it, had fallen out. Quick as a flash it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
came over her that Bert was responsible for the
mouse’s appearance in the schoolroom, but she said
nothing about it, although she thought: “That is
just like Elizabeth; she wouldn’t tell for fear Bert
would be found out.”</p>

<p>She felt that she had the key to the whole situation
and made up her mind that Miss Jewett should
know.</p>

<p>The opportunity for telling was soon afforded her,
for when she reached home there sat Miss Jewett.
“Oh,” exclaimed Betsy, “were you here to supper,
Miss Jewett?”</p>

<p>“I feel quite sure of it,” returned her teacher with
a smile.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t they tell me you were coming?”
said Betsy, aggrieved. “I wouldn’t have gone out
if I had known.”</p>

<p>“Maybe that is why they didn’t tell,” said Miss
Jewett with a little twinkle in her eye.</p>

<p>Betsy did not know quite how to take this, so she
said nothing.</p>

<p>“Did you find Elizabeth better?” said Miss Jewett,
somewhat formally.</p>

<p>“Yes, she was much better,” Betsy answered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
“She will be well enough to come to school tomorrow.”</p>

<p>Miss Jewett did not answer. She seemed to be
thinking deeply. Presently she said, “Betsy, I
wonder if you can throw any light on this matter of
Elizabeth and the mouse. Did she really bring it
to school with her? I know she is full of fun and
likes to do unusual things, but I could scarce believe
my ears when she told me that she put it in her
desk herself.”</p>

<p>“Of course she didn’t bring it to school,”—Betsy
spoke indignantly. “She saw it running across a
desk and she jumped up and caught it so as to prevent
a disturbance. She told me all about it this
evening.”</p>

<p>“Why, Betsy, is that true? Then why in the world
didn’t she tell me?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; she said she was sort of rattled;
and then, you won’t be mad, Miss Jewett, she was
proud and didn’t see how you could suspect her of
doing it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I am sorry,” returned Miss Jewett.
“She didn’t deny that she had put it in her desk,
and I didn’t care to question further, for I was feeling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
rather hurt myself. Did you see her catch it,
Betsy?”</p>

<p>“I saw her jump up suddenly and then I saw her
pop something in her desk. I heard it running
around but I didn’t know at first what it was.”</p>

<p>“Dear me, dear me,” murmured Miss Jewett.
“I wish she had told me.”</p>

<p>“Miss Jewett,” said Betsy presently, “if I tell you
a secret, will you promise not to let anyone know?
I hate to be a telltale, but I want you to know just
how fine Elizabeth really is. She would rather
take the blame herself than have the real person
suffer.”</p>

<p>“Oh dear, Betsy, that is asking a good deal.
Perhaps I should not make such a promise, yet if it
exonerates Elizabeth I should be glad to know. Yes,
I will keep the secret.”</p>

<p>“I will tell you what I think and why I think it,”
began Betsy, and went on to relate how she had discovered
the lunch box with the nibbled cake and all
the rest of it, ending up with: “It would be just
like Bert to do it; he is so full of mischief. Why,
last year he brought a little grass snake to school
and almost frightened Miss Dunbar out of her wits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
by putting it on the ledge under the black-board.
She caught him, though, and he had to stay in for
days and days after school and learn lines and lines
of something or other.”</p>

<p>“He deserves to be well punished now,” declared
Miss Jewett, “but as we have only what is called
circumstantial evidence I suppose he must escape.
I am glad you told me, however, for I am pretty
sure you are right, and when I see Elizabeth I shall
be able to use more diplomacy. Poor Elizabeth, to
think that she took it so to heart.”</p>

<p>“She said that it wouldn’t have seemed so terrible
if you had kissed her good-bye as you always did
before. She seemed to feel worse about that than
anything else. She thought that meant that you
had stopped loving her.”</p>

<p>“The blessed child, of course I haven’t stopped
loving her.”</p>

<p>“May I tell her that you send your love to her
and good-night? I can speak to her over the ’phone,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, do tell her that and ask her to come to school
early so I can have a word with her before work
begins. I must go and put on my things now, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
you know there is an entertainment at the Hall and
we are all going.”</p>

<p>“You mean you grown-ups; we children are not.
Hal and Kathie have gone already.”</p>

<p>As soon as the front door closed after her elders
Betsy went to the telephone, called up Elizabeth
and delivered Miss Jewett’s message. Elizabeth’s
answer came back: “Oh, I am so rejoiceful. I shall
sleep a sweet and dreamless slumber tonight, Betsy.
You are a friend indeed to pour the oil of gladness
upon my bruised and bleeding heart. I certainly will
start to school early. What? Yes, I have studied
them, for, even if I had no heart to acquire any more
knowledge, I felt that I must do my duty to my parents
no matter how I suffered. Good-night, dearest
Phillipa, your Frederica wafts you a kiss.”</p>

<p>True to her promise, Elizabeth started off betimes
to school the next morning. She did not stop for
Betsy as usual, believing that she would not have
finished breakfast, and as for Bess it was quite positive
that she would still be at table for she loved to
linger till the last moment. Miss Jewett greeted
her with a smile. Elizabeth was the first arrival, as
she hoped she would be. The schoolroom was fresh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
and bright, cheery with warmth of sun and blazing
fire. Some scarlet geraniums in the window were
beginning to put forth blossoms, while a great poinsettia,
a Christmas gift to Miss Jewett, still showed
its large and brilliant flowers amidst the green of
palms and ferns.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Elizabeth,” said Miss Jewett
brightly. “Come up here and let us straighten out
that unfortunate misunderstanding. You foolish
child, why didn’t you tell me yesterday how it happened
that you put the mouse in your desk? I
might never have known if it had not been for Betsy.
To be sure, I should have gone deeper into the matter
and have inquired your motive, but I thought the
least said the soonest mended, and after you had
acknowledged that you put it there I thought that
settled it. I am sorry, dear.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I should have told you,” answered
Elizabeth, “but somehow I couldn’t. I felt all
twisted up and contrary, and the more you talked
about it the worse it was till at last I couldn’t have
said anything if I had tried.”</p>

<p>“I see. And you captured the mouse simply to
save me a scare and the school a disturbance?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>“Yes, Miss Jewett, although—” Elizabeth hesitated;
but she was too honest not to go on, “although
I was kind of half glad to have it happen: it made
such a nice excitement.”</p>

<p>“But it was not your intention to start such an
excitement,” replied Miss Jewett with a smile, “and
that is the main point. It has not been such a long
time since I was a schoolgirl for me to forget that
any interruption of routine is welcome. We’ll call
it square, Elizabeth, if you like. I think we were
both a little wrong. Come and give me a good hug
and kiss before anyone comes.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth did not hesitate to respond to the invitation,
receiving as hearty a hug as she gave. “I
think it was because I love you so much that I felt
so badly,” she whispered.</p>

<p>“Dear child,” murmured Miss Jewett. “Hereafter
we must speak right out, dear, and not allow any
more misunderstandings.” Then two or three children
came trooping in and Elizabeth went to her
seat feeling very happy.</p>

<p>Believing that Elizabeth’s part in the yesterday’s
disturbance might not be known, Miss Jewett took
pains to inform the school of the little girl’s motives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
and at the same time she gave a lecture which was
really aimed at Bert who felt most uneasy when he
learned how unhappy he had made his sister. Indeed,
Betsy took it upon herself to charge him with
being the guilty one.</p>

<p>“I should think you would be ashamed of yourself,
Bert Hollins,” she began at recess when she
could get him out of hearing of the others. “I know
it was you who brought the mouse to school, for I
saw the holes in your lunch box and the cooky that
the mouse had nibbled. Don’t you know that Elizabeth
got the whole blame for it, and cried herself
sick about it? She wasn’t such a sneaky coward
as to allow the blame to fall on you where it belonged
and she let Miss Jewett believe it was she who did
it just to keep you out of trouble.”</p>

<p>“Gee!” exclaimed Bert, “I didn’t know that. I
vow I didn’t, Betsy. Was that why she didn’t eat
any dinner and didn’t go to school in the afternoon?”</p>

<p>“It was exactly that, if you must know, and I
should think you would be ashamed to let a girl be
braver than you; I wouldn’t if I were a boy.”</p>

<p>Bert got very red in the face. There was nothing
he resented so much as an attack upon his courage.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
He stood looking very glum while Betsy berated
him. “What do you expect me to do?” he said at
last.</p>

<p>“What any manly and gentlemanly person would
do,” returned Betsy with dignity, and walked away,
having had her say.</p>

<p>Bert stood there in a most uncomfortable state of
mind. The subject which he thought at rest had
come back upon him like a boomerang. If Betsy
knew he wondered if Miss Jewett did likewise. Of
course Betsy had only guessed at it for he had not
actually admitted that she was right. He wondered
if Elizabeth was still under suspicion and he eyed her
very closely when the return to his seat gave him an
opportunity. She seemed as usual. He could see
no traces of unhappiness in her face, but she knew
and Betsy knew, so it was up to him to do something.
He wouldn’t let a girl have more courage than he
had. It was fine of Elizabeth, of course, but he almost
wished she hadn’t put him in this position, for
now he had two things to answer for instead of one.
He had begun the mischief and had let her take the
blame. Well, of course no man could allow that.
All afternoon Bert was most saintly, so much so that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
Miss Jewett felt that Betsy was right in her suspicions.
He went out with the rest, for Miss Jewett
had no intention of calling him to account.</p>

<p>However, the schoolroom was scarcely emptied
before Bert appeared in the doorway. He stood there
twirling his cap and looking most uneasy.</p>

<p>“Well, Bert,” said Miss Jewett encouragingly.</p>

<p>“It was me,” said Bert doggedly, if ungrammatically.
“I was the fellow that let that mouse out. I
brought him to school on purpose to have some fun;
it wasn’t Elizabeth at all.”</p>

<p>“I know that,” Miss Jewett said calmly, “and I
was pretty sure of the guilty person, but on Elizabeth’s
account I overlooked it. It was pretty good
of her, don’t you think, Bert, to try to shield you?”</p>

<p>“It was, sure,” replied Bert. “She’s the stuff, but
I ’most wish she hadn’t.”</p>

<p>“You think that since she did not succeed in preventing
a disturbance it would have been better all
around? Well, I think so too, so far as that one thing
was concerned, but it has done something else which
I think is more worth while. It has proved to you
and to me that she is loyal to her brother and to
me, that she has courage, moral courage, which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
the best kind, and so we have learned how absolutely
she is to be depended upon.”</p>

<p>“She’s all right,” repeated Bert.</p>

<p>“It has proved to me another thing that I might
not have found out,” Miss Jewett went on: “it has
shown me that you have moral courage, too, and
that you are not willing to let your sister shoulder
the blame which is really yours. That is worth
while knowing, too, Bert. I am mighty glad of that.
So, because it would grieve your sister to know that
in spite of her efforts you were punished, and because
of one or two other things, we are going to close the
subject right now. But, listen, Bert, if ever you do
such a thing again—” Miss Jewett did not say
what would happen but by the expression of her face
Bert knew he would not be let off easily.</p>

<p>He stood for a minute not knowing exactly what
to say. He had had something of a lecture, to be
sure, but he had been commended for having the
courage to own up. He did not feel that he could
depart with flying colors, exactly, yet he was not in
disgrace, nor was there any occasion to show defiance.
Probably the best thing was to show neither the
mien of conqueror nor of vanquished, but to take his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
leave in a polite but firmly resolute manner. So he
bowed and said pleasantly: “Good-evening, Miss
Jewett. I don’t believe I will bother with bringing
any more mice to school.” Then he went without a
moment’s delay, leaving Miss Jewett shaking with
laughter.</p>

<p>“They are so ridiculous, those two Hollins children,”
she said to herself. “I wonder if I will get
through the year with any dignity left. Teaching
does take it out of one, but I must say that at times
there are compensations. I wish I could tell exactly
what was passing through that youngster’s mind
when he went out in that absurd way.”</p>

<p>It did not make the slightest difference to Bert
whether she knew or not; his whole feeling was of
relief at having put an unpleasant interview behind
him. There was but one more thing required of
him and that could be made short work of. He put
his intention into effect at the very first moment he
could. There was no need of appearing anything
but lordly before his own sister, so with hands in
his pockets, he sauntered into Elizabeth’s presence.</p>

<p>He found her absorbed in studying her lessons for
the next day, being fired with new ambition after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
the reconciliation. “I say,” said Bert, breaking in
upon the doings of the English kings.</p>

<p>“Oh, what do you want, Bert,” said Elizabeth
impatiently. “Can’t you see I am studying my
lessons?”</p>

<p>“I just wanted to say that I am much obliged to
you for being so decent about that mouse business.
I told Miss Jewett that it was my doings.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bert, and what did she do?”</p>

<p>“Oh nothing. I told her I wouldn’t bring any
more to school.” Then Bert sauntered out with the
air of having disposed of a very trifling matter. But
Elizabeth understood.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small><span class="smcap">The Artist</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was one afternoon early in March that Elizabeth
started out to look for pussywillows. She went
alone, for she wanted to be the one to make this
first spring offering to her teacher. She could not,
like Betsy, supply her with flowers from a conservatory,
nor had she such a weekly allowance as Bess,
who could, once in awhile, commission Hal to send
violets from town, but these firstlings of the year
were hers for the gathering, if only she could find
them. She thought she knew a place where some
of the brave little furry buds might have put out
sooner than their neighbors and to this spot she
took her way.</p>

<p>It was the first day which had suggested a promise
of spring. There was a pleasant warmth in the
air, a smell of fresh earth. Under the brown leaves
were tiny green growths beginning to push up.</p>

<p>Some patches of snow still lingered in northbound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
corners, but the little streams had broken from their
bonds and were murmuring along singing of all sorts
of pleasant things to Elizabeth, who had a knowledge
of their speech and could interpret what they
were saying. It was all about spring and green
grasses, birds’ nests and flowers. The ground was soft
in places, but, for a wonder, Elizabeth had put on
rubbers and sprang over the marshy spots without
getting over the tops of her shoes. She loved to scour
the woods and fields with Betsy, but once in awhile
she revelled in being alone, and today she especially
enjoyed it. She stood still once or twice to listen
to a bluebird and by keeping very quiet at last caught
sight of the flash of blue which told of his presence.</p>

<p>“I see you,” she called as he flew away, “and I
know what you are singing about. I know what the
brook says, too. It is a spring song, and I am so
glad, so glad. I am happy, you bluebird! I am
happy, you brook,” she sang. “It’s a gladsome day
in this quiet nook! That is my song. I made it up.
I am an improvisatrice. Oh!”</p>

<p>After the exclamation she stopped her song and
dashed through the bushes, regardless of how briars
snatched at her and muddy pools splashed her frock.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
“There you are! you dear things,” she cried. “I
thought I would find you out. I will not take all
of you, but I will take enough to make a company
so you will not be lonely. I hope you like to go,
and maybe you will like it better when you get
there, for the schoolroom is really very pleasant,
and you will have the honor of standing on Miss
Jewett’s desk; that should compensiation for all else.
You are not so very far out yet, but if you are put
in water in the warm room you will soon show more
fur. I know just the vase Miss Jewett will put you
in, and you will look lovely. You are the very first,
the very first, and I found you.”</p>

<p>She chattered away as she broke off the twigs,
finally saying, “There, I think that is enough. I
am much obliged to you, Mrs. Pussywillow, for
letting me take some of your pretty buds. I will
come to see you again some day.” Then she climbed
up the slope stretching down to the brook, looking
from time to time with much satisfaction at the little
gray fuzzy buds.</p>

<p>When she reached the top of the hill she paused
for a moment that she might determine upon the
best way, and then started to cross the field diagonally.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
Just before she reached the corner of the
fence she stopped short, surprised to see before her
a young man sitting on a camp-stool with a black
box in his lap. Elizabeth was curious to know what
he could be doing, and began to move slowly nearer
to him until she came within his line of vision.</p>

<p>The young man looked over the top of his box at
her. “Good-evening, Aurora,” he said.</p>

<p>Supposing that he mistook her for someone else,
Elizabeth made reply: “My name isn’t Aurora.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t? I should have thought it was. Then
you are a woodland elf and live down in those woods
that you have just come from. It was just a case
of mistaken identity; that was all. Good-evening,
Elfie.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth smiled. This was certainly a very unusual
young man. Some persons might have said
he was crazy, but Elizabeth recognized a kindred
spirit. “Good-evening,” she said, encouraged to
draw a little nearer that she might see what he was
really doing.</p>

<p>But before she reached him the young man arose,
set his box on the stool and stood off at a few paces,
squinting at it with half-closed eyes. Then he made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
a sudden dash forward, made a dab at the lid of the
box and returned to the place he had been standing.
“Come here,” he said, “and tell me what you think
of it.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth obeyed the invitation with alacrity and
saw that the young man held a palette and brushes
and that in the top of his box was fastened a small
canvas upon which he had been working. All these
things were quite new to Elizabeth. She was familiar
with her sister’s box of water-colors, but this
paraphernalia was strange. She reached the young
man’s side and looked at the canvas with pleased
eyes. “Why, it is a picture,” she said.</p>

<p>“You don’t say so,” returned the young man.
“Is it really?”</p>

<p>“What else could it be?” said Elizabeth, a little
puzzled.</p>

<p>“Oh, it might be a chart of the county or a section
of a map, or almost anything. It might be something
like this.” He picked up a clean canvas from the
pile on the ground and began to draw swiftly with a
stump of charcoal. “This might be the main road,”
he said, “and these the branch roads and these the
houses.” He rubbed his drawing in two or three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
places and then turned the canvas so Elizabeth could
see.</p>

<p>“Why, it looks just like a bunch of pussywillows,”
she exclaimed in surprise.</p>

<p>“Does it? How funny. Can’t you see the main
road, and the little roads? Those round spots are
the houses.” He looked down with a smile, and
Elizabeth understood that he had really meant it
to be a branch of pussywillows, the buds being the
houses.</p>

<p>She gave him an answering smile. “But the other
is a truly picture,” she said; “this is an enigmatrical
one.”</p>

<p>“Lovely,” cried the young man, laughing. “I like
that word ‘enigmatrical,’ and I shall take it into my
vocabulary.” He looked down at Elizabeth again
with a broad smile. “By the way,” he said, “did
you ever hear of Titian?”</p>

<p>Elizabeth was doubtful. The name sounded familiar
and yet she thought best not to display any
knowledge lest she might make a mistake. “I think
I have heard of him,” she said. “Who is he?”</p>

<p>“A painter.”</p>

<p>“Oh, are you he?” She thought he might very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
well be and that this was his way of informing
her.</p>

<p>“Ye gods and little fishes!” cried the young man.
“Listen to her. Do I look as if I were over three
hundred years old?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh,”—Elizabeth was quite abashed. “I didn’t
remember that he was so old.”</p>

<p>“He lived over three hundred years ago,” continued
the young man, “but if he were here now he
would probably say to you, ‘My dear demoselle,
will you oblige me by taking off your cap and sitting
over there where the sun can shine on your lovely
head?’ Only he would say it in Italian, for he probably
couldn’t speak English.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth pulled down the rim of her cap closer
over her curling locks. She was afraid the young
man was making fun of her.</p>

<p>“What are you doing that for?” asked the artist.
“Don’t you like your hair?”</p>

<p>“I hate it,” said Elizabeth in low, tense tones. “I
should like to dye it black or brown or even green.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, not green; you wouldn’t really rather
have it green. It would make you so conspicuous.”</p>

<p>“Yes, even green. Nobody likes red hair. My<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
family and my friends try to comfort me by saying
it is auburn, but I know, myself, that it is red, for
the people that don’t like me always say so.”</p>

<p>“Then it is because they are mean and jealous.
The great Titian adored hair the color of yours and
painted lovely females with just such many, many
times.”</p>

<p>“Did he really?” Elizabeth said in delighted surprise.
“I wish I could see some of them.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will some day. I have a copy of
one. I wish I had it here to convince you. I did it
when I was abroad and they say it is a pretty good
copy, Elfie, if I do say it as shouldn’t.”</p>

<p>“I would give anything to see it,” declared Elizabeth,
“and I wish Corinne Barker could see it, too.”</p>

<p>“Why, Corinne?” inquired the artist, beginning
to pack up his paints and brushes.</p>

<p>“Oh, because she is so—so—snippy and hateful.
She makes fun of my hair whenever she can, and
tries to make everyone think I am a sight.” She
did not know why she was disposed to be so confidential
with this perfect stranger, but somehow he
invited confidence.</p>

<p>“Then no doubt she is consumed with jealousy,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
her new friend remarked. “I will venture to say
that she has dull, mouse-colored hair herself, dry,
wispy hair that hangs down in little strings around
her face and never looks tidy. I will bet you that
I can make a portrait of her without seeing her.”
He picked up the canvas on which he had drawn
the pussywillows, dusted off the charcoal and began
sketching rapidly. “There,” he said, when he had
worked for a very few minutes, “doesn’t that look
just like her?” He showed Elizabeth the drawing
he had made. It was a face with a most disagreeable
and contemptuous expression. Little strings of hair
fell over the forehead and the eyebrows were lifted
in disdain.</p>

<p>Elizabeth did not like to say that it was not an
exact likeness, but she laughed at the funny drawing
and said, “She has just that supercillious expression.”</p>

<p>The young man put down the canvas and looked at
Elizabeth gravely. “Those attacks are entirely too
frequent for a young person of your size,” he said.
“Where do you go to school?”</p>

<p>“I go to the village school, but next year I expect
to go to the Academy.”</p>

<p>“Will you tell your teacher for me that you have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
the most remarkable vocabulary and that you are
a credit to her system. I suppose you live near here,
Elfie?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I live in the brown house just at the edge
of the town.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know the place very well. I came over
today from Ferny with one Hiram Sollers. He said
it was ‘pretty sightly to Brookdale.’” The imitation
of the old farmer’s dialect was perfect and Elizabeth
laughed.</p>

<p>“I have come to the conclusion that Hiram was
right,” continued the artist. “I believe I would like
to knock about here for awhile. I should like mightily
to paint you, Elfie.”</p>

<p>“Me? What for?” Elizabeth showed her surprise.</p>

<p>“Dear innocent, because I feel the mantle of
Titian falling upon my shoulders, I suppose. I
can’t imagine any other reason. I might stick a
suggestion of you in this picture I am starting; you
and your pussywillows would come in nicely. Suppose
you go over there for a minute, just there where
the sun is shining. I won’t keep you long. Oh dear,
you must take off your cap. I don’t want the glory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
of that auroral halo to be lost. That’s it. Now
look this way for a minute. Good! Hold the bunch
of pussies in your arms this way. That’s it.” He
worked away earnestly and rapidly for several minutes.
The time seemed very long to Elizabeth, although
she was buoyed up by the excitement of
going through such an unusual experience. At last
she shifted her position, becoming more and more
restless, and wondering how much longer she would
have to stand.</p>

<p>“There, time’s up,” said the young man at last.
“You did pretty well. It’s no fun to be a model, I
know. How would you like to be at it all day?
Some persons earn their living that way you
know.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth thought it must be a very tiresome way
of making one’s living and was glad she did not have
to do it. She came back to see what the artist had
made of her, and was rather disappointed to see a
few daubs which did not represent a true likeness of
Elizabeth Hollins, she thought.</p>

<p>“If you stand off a little it will look more like,”
suggested her friend.</p>

<p>Elizabeth went off a short distance and, to her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
surprise, found that there was a distinct image of a
little girl with shining hair standing in the background
of the picture. “Why, that does look like
me,” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“You didn’t think it possible, did you, Elfie?
Well, we all have to learn. I will try to finish this
up tomorrow. Shall we walk your way? You can
show me where you live and then I will go on to the
Mansion House. I cannot say that I would be
overcome with joy if I had to think of staying there
long, but it is the best there is, I am told.”</p>

<p>“It is rather smelly,” Elizabeth acknowledged.
“I shouldn’t like to live there myself.”</p>

<p>“Smelly, my dear Elfie? I am surprised. Why
not malodorous or mephitic, or some such adjective.
One who follows the style of the respected Dr.
Johnson should not use such a very ordinary word
as smelly. Now, if I said smelly, it would be all
right, for I do not aim at anything but extreme simplicity
in speech as in other things.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth felt that he was making fun of her, but
he did it so good-naturedly that she could not take
offence, so she only laughed and they walked on, the
artist carrying his box in one hand and a lot of wet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
brushes in the other. Elizabeth wondered why he
did not put the brushes in the box.</p>

<p>As if reading her thoughts, the young man said:
“If I don’t carry my brushes in this way I may forget
to wash them; I sometimes do and then don’t I
have a time to get them clean? By the way, Elfie,
I have not properly introduced myself.” He picked
up a shining brown leaf from the ground, selected a
brush which still held some red paint, and with it
wrote on the leaf which he handed gravely to
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>She took it gingerly so as not to rub off the paint.
What a delightful man he was, to be sure, and how
unlike any other person she had met. She looked
earnestly at what he had written. It was: “Oliver
Kemp, a reincarnation of Titian.” Elizabeth had
not the slightest idea what reincarnation meant,
and she looked up questioningly to see laughter in
the young man’s eyes, so she knew it was a sort of
joke, but she determined to keep the leaf as a treasure.
She held it very carefully by the stem, carrying her
pussywillows in the other hand. “You don’t know
my name,” she said presently.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I do: it is Elfie.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>“You have the first two letters right,” said Elizabeth
gayly.</p>

<p>“That is quite enough; I needn’t try for any more.
It is a great satisfaction to get things partly right:
I don’t always do it, I know,” he added, partly to
himself.</p>

<p>They had reached the long street by this time and
Mr. Kemp stood still and looked up and down,
toward the church spire, the white, brown or red
houses, the rows of trees each side the street in one
direction and, in the other, hills, forests and winding
road. “Do you know, Elfie,” he said, “I like this
village of yours and I should like to stay here for
awhile. Do you know of any place like a chicken-coop
or a wood-house or any little cubby where I
could keep my stool and easel and where I could
paint when it was too cold or too stormy to go out?”</p>

<p>“A chicken-coop wouldn’t be big enough,” returned
Elizabeth in all gravity, “but maybe a hen-house
would do. I don’t exactly think of any just
now, but maybe I could hear of something.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good child; I wish you would. I will
come up tomorrow and find out. You live,—let
me see, where is it you live?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>“In that brown house off there at the end of the
street,”—Elizabeth pointed it out to him.</p>

<p>“Of course; I might have known it would be
brown, like a tree. I suppose you go in there only
when it is very cold or stormy and stay in the woods
the rest of the time; elves always do, you know.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth laughed. “I do like to stay out as much
as I can,” she made answer, “but I love the woods
and the fields better in warm weather than in cold.”</p>

<p>“And have you a hollow stump where you stay
sometimes?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I really have one; it is in the little hollow
behind the house; I call it the Fairy Dell.”</p>

<p>“Of course you do; I could have vouched for that.”</p>

<p>“There is another place,”—Elizabeth felt encouraged
to go on,—“It is on top of the hill; there are
great bowlders there and the witches come there at
midnight.”</p>

<p>“How truly fascinating. You must show me the
spot some day.”</p>

<p>“But,” Elizabeth went on, “I have a lovely place
in the attic all my own; it is under the eaves and there
is a nice window there that looks out over the
country. Sometimes I make believe that it is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
window high up in a moated castle tower and sometimes
I pretend it is a really fairy lodge in the tree-tops.”</p>

<p>“Bless you, Elfie; you are a creature after my own
heart. I will go to the gate with you and you can
show me the window.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth readily agreed and when they had
reached the brown house she pointed out the little
window in the pointed gable, a wistaria vine clambered
to it and would soon be ready to put out its
first leaves.</p>

<p>“It looks exactly as I thought it must,” declared
Mr. Kemp. “I am coming to see you tomorrow,
Elfie. I suppose it must be after school is out.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, for I shall not be at home till then,” returned
Elizabeth soberly.</p>

<p>He put down his box to shake hands while she
laid aside her pussywillows. Then they parted and
Elizabeth, brimming over with excitement, hurried
into the house.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ELIZABETH rushed panting into her mother’s
presence. “Such an adventure,”—she gasped.
“Never in my wildest moments did I ever dream of
such a delicious encounter; that I, of all people,
should be so highly favored is almost uncomprehensible.”</p>

<p>“If there are any adventures floating around I’ll
be bound you will lasso one,” said Kathie, amused
at Elizabeth’s manner of announcement. “What are
those? Pussywillows, as I live! I didn’t know they
were out. Give them to me and I will put them in
water; they will be nice for the table.”</p>

<p>But Elizabeth held on to her treasures. “I got
them for Miss Jewett,” she said. “You can’t have
them, Kathie.”</p>

<p>“Well, I do think you might think of your own
home first,” returned Kathie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>“The other girls all have such lovely things to
give her,” complained Elizabeth. “Betsy has flowers
from the conservatory and Bess has money enough
to send to town for any she wants to give, but I
have only what I can find myself. I did want to
take these because they are the very first and nobody
else has thought of them. Do I have to give
them up, mother?”</p>

<p>“Let her do as she pleases with them, Kathie,”
said Mrs. Hollins. “She has a right to them and
you should not interfere with her little innocent
plans. What is this about an adventure, Elizabeth?”</p>

<p>“I have met an artist, a real live artist,” she said,
sitting up with shining eyes. “It was just after I
found the pussywillows. I came across him as he was
sitting painting, and, oh mother, he put me in the
picture; he really did.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure you are not making this up?” asked
Kathie.</p>

<p>“No, indeed, I am not. I can prove it to you; for
here is his valuable name. Be careful,” she warned,
as she held out the leaf, “the paint is not dry yet.”</p>

<p>“Paint?” Kathie exclaimed, taking the leaf in her
hand and reading the name. “Why, Elizabeth, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
must be some sort of crazy creature to be calling
himself a reincarnation of Titian.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that part is just a joke,” returned Elizabeth.
“He said there was an artist named Titian
who liked red hair. I didn’t know that he lived such
a long, long time ago and I asked Mr. Kemp if he
were Titian; that was before I knew his name. Did
you ever hear of Titian, mother?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, dear, of course I have. He was a very
famous man, and his pictures now bring fabulous
prices.”</p>

<p>“Tell us some more about your discovery,” said
Kathie, now really interested.</p>

<p>“He is very nice and jolly,” Elizabeth went on,
“and he likes it here in Brookdale. He came over
from Ferny and is staying at the Mansion House.”</p>

<p>“Poor thing, I am sorry for him,” remarked
Kathie.</p>

<p>“Oh, he doesn’t like it himself. He asked me if
I knew of a chicken-coop or something little where
he could put his easel and things.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he wants a studio, does he? I don’t know
where he will find one in this place,” said Mrs.
Hollins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>“It would be rather a distinction to have an artist
among us,” remarked Kathie. “Of course he was
just in fun when he said a chicken-coop, Elizabeth;
he would want something larger and with a good
light. Can you think of any place, mother?”</p>

<p>“Why, no, nothing occurs to me just now; I may
think of something later on. We will ask your
father.”</p>

<p>“He is coming to see me tomorrow, Mr. Kemp is,”
Elizabeth spoke up. “He thought maybe I would
hear of some place by then.”</p>

<p>“Well, I declare,” responded Kathie, “you have
rushed into a friendship sure enough; the next thing
he will be wanting to paint your portrait”; she
spoke half mockingly.</p>

<p>“Oh, he has already said he would like to,” Elizabeth
said calmly.</p>

<p>“Well, well,”—Kathie looked at her with new interest.
Being a pretty girl herself she had never
thought that Elizabeth would attract the eye of an
artist as she was very unlike her sister. “We shall
certainly have to inquire around and see what we
can do for him.”</p>

<p>“We shall have to inquire around and find out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
something about the young man himself,” said Mrs.
Hollins.</p>

<p>After all it was Elizabeth who made the discovery
of a suitable studio, or at least of a place which could
be turned into one. Probably less ingenious persons
than herself and Mr. Kemp would never have
thought of it, but these two saw its possibilities
when they went on a search in company.</p>

<p>The young man appeared as he had promised, the
next afternoon. Elizabeth proudly presented him
to her mother and father, who were not long in
satisfying themselves that he was a gentleman, that
he was well known by certain of their acquaintances
in the nearby town and that they need have no hesitation
in admitting him into their circle. He was
very nice and courteous to Kathie, but it was evidently
Elizabeth whom he had selected as chief
friend and, later on, she was permitted to go off
with him to hunt up a studio.</p>

<p>They tried the village first, but here there were
only one or two possibilities, a small house with a
dreary outlook, a loft over a store, where it was
noisy and inconvenient.</p>

<p>“Won’t do, Elfie,” said Mr. Kemp, shaking his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
head. “I must be ‘far from the madding crowd,’
and I must have a north light, or at least a place
where I could put in a window on the north side if
necessary.”</p>

<p>“Why do you want it on the north side? It is
so cold there in winter. Do you like the north better
than any other place?”</p>

<p>“No, my child, I do not, but be it known to you
that the light varies less, the sun doesn’t gallop
around so recklessly and doesn’t throw such exasperating
reflections and shadows on your canvas.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth didn’t understand why this should make
any very great difference, but it did seem a reason
from an artist’s point of view and she accepted it.
She felt that she might learn many new things if
this lately acquired friend should remain with
them.</p>

<p>They had wandered up and down the road, had
peered in at the out-buildings of more than one small
farm, and finally returned by the back road to
Elizabeth’s own home. “That is where my cousin
Ruth lives,” said Elizabeth, pointing out a gray
stone house plainly seen through the bare trees.
“It is a very pretty place. We can go through it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
if you like, for there is a little gate just ahead. I
think you would like to see the old spring with the
little statue over it and there is a lovely view from
the summer-house.”</p>

<p>“Let us go by all means,” agreed Mr. Kemp;
“I am interested in fine views and ‘the old spring
with a statue’ sounds most alluring.”</p>

<p>“My cousins aren’t here now,” Elizabeth told
him; “but they are coming back soon. Ruth had
the measles and had to go to Florida for the winter,
but as soon as the weather is warm enough they
will come back.”</p>

<p>They entered through the little gate and first
visited the spring from which issued a small stream
which went purling down the hill. The spring had
been restoned and the little statue, although somewhat
weather-stained, was in pretty good condition.
“There,” exclaimed Elizabeth proudly, “isn’t that
lovely? Ruth and I discovered it first, and we like
this place to play in better than any.”</p>

<p>“It is rather nice,” said the young man, looking
around critically. “A little too much cleaned up
to be really artistic, you know; but it isn’t half bad.
I wouldn’t mind making a study of it; I suppose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
there would be no objection to my coming in here
to do it while the family are away.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am sure you may,” returned Elizabeth.
“We keep the keys of the house, but there is a man
who looks after the place and the animals. He lives
in the new garage; he has a room over it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kemp stepped to this side and that, looking
at the spring from different points of view, gazing
through his half-closed hand in a way that he had,
and which Elizabeth was learning to imitate.</p>

<p>“Now, let’s go to the summer-house,” said Elizabeth,
leading the way to the top of the hill; “it is
all fixed over and Grandpa Gil likes to come up here
and sit.”</p>

<p>“Well, I say, this is stunning,” remarked Mr.
Kemp when they had reached the spot. “Not very
paintable, perhaps, but it gives you a mighty good
idea of the surrounding country. I say, Elfie, what
is that down there?”</p>

<p>Elizabeth looked in the direction he indicated.
“Why, that,” she told him, “is where the old farm-house
used to be; it was burned down and that is
only the foundation. Cousin Tom didn’t rebuild it,
because the garage is nearer and has all the room
that is needed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>“I didn’t mean the foundation, although with
vines and underbrush growing over it I imagine it
is rather picturesque, but what I was looking at was
the small building near it; what is that?”</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t know exactly; they don’t use it
now. I think it was a sort of stable first and then
they used it for the chickens.” She broke off
abruptly and gave a little squeal. “Oh, Mr. Titian,
maybe we have found it.”</p>

<p>“That is just what I was thinking, Elfie; let’s go
and see.”</p>

<p>They lost no time in rushing toward the old
weather-beaten building which stood on the side
of the hill quite a distance from the main house. A
large tree sheltered it on the south side, but on the
north and west the view was unobstructed. A little
path led from it to the spring. It was rather dilapidated,
windows broken and roof leaky. Mr. Kemp
went around to see if there might be a door unfastened
or a shutter loose, and at last he found a place
where they could get in. Elizabeth thought it the
greatest fun to be boosted up over the sill of the window,
where they made their entrance, and to land on
the dusty floor inside. “We are like discoverers,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
she said. “It is pretty bad, isn’t it? Such a lot of
cobwebs, and you can look up and see daylight right
through some of the holes in the roof, and it is rather
malodorous from the chickens.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kemp laughed. “You got it, didn’t you, that
time. I say, Elfie, it isn’t half so bad as it looks.
A few shingles will make the roof all right, I think.
I could knock out a place over here, you see, and
put in a couple of window-sashes and I would have
a good light. There over in that corner I could
carry that partition all the way up and make a sort
of kitchenette or something of the sort. There seems
to be a solid floor over the greater part of it, and—yes,
there is a ladder, as I live; I’ll go up and see
what it looks like above there. No, don’t you come;
you might fall.”</p>

<p>He raised the ladder, ran lightly up, and through
the apertures made by the absence of boards Elizabeth
could see him above. “Not bad,” he called
down to her. “With a little work one could make
a fair room up here.”</p>

<p>He came down presently and Elizabeth begged
to go part way so she could look around. This
she was permitted to do, Mr. Kemp standing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
below telling her he would catch her if she should
fall.</p>

<p>“There is quite good head room,” he said, “much
more than you would suppose. Why, Elfie, one
could really live here and be quite comfortable in
mild weather. For an impecunious artist it would
be ideal. Now, how do you suppose we’d better
go about getting it? I can do all the repairing myself,
and they wouldn’t be likely to charge much
rent, would they?”</p>

<p>“If they would rent it at all,” returned Elizabeth
a little doubtfully.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t interfere with them: I would be very
unobtrusive,” Mr. Kemp went on in a boyish way.
“Do you suppose your father would take it upon
himself to dicker for it on my behalf?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Elizabeth answered; “but it
wouldn’t do any harm to ask him.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s go and do it now,” suggested the young
man. “The sooner the better for me. To tell you
the truth, Elfie, the Mansion House is getting on
my nerves. The coffee this morning was something
indescribable, and I don’t know whether it was
leather, old boot-tops, the binding of a discarded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
book, or a worn-out saddle that they served up as
steak.”</p>

<p>“Oh dear!” This description aroused Elizabeth’s
pity and she was ready to do anything in
order to release her friend from such a condition.
So they scrambled out of the window again, looking
back more than once at the building on the side of
the hill.</p>

<p>“What is the name of your cousins?” asked Mr.
Kemp as they went toward Elizabeth’s home.</p>

<p>“Gilmore,” she told him. “Cousin Tom Gilmore
is the one who owns the place.”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose by any stretch of the imagination
it could be any relation to the Tom Gilmore
who married Belle Darby.”</p>

<p>“Why, yes it is. At least cousin Tom’s wife is
cousin Belle.”</p>

<p>“His father is a tall old gentleman, has trouble
with his eyes, has been living in California?”</p>

<p>“Why yes, that is Grandpa Gil. He is a great
friend of mine.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” Mr. Kemp tossed up his hat and
shouted joyously. “It’s all right, Elfie; I am sure
of it, for one of the Gilmore boys married my cousin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
and we have known them all our lives. I didn’t
know Tom Gilmore was living here.”</p>

<p>“They haven’t been very long,” Elizabeth told
him. “They only came last year. It is cousin Belle
who is my mother’s first cousin. Why, we are sort
of related, aren’t we?”</p>

<p>“Certainly we are. I say, Elfie, but this is great.
I had no idea I was falling upon such luck. I will
telegraph to Tom myself and I am sure it will be
all right.”</p>

<p>And so it proved to be. The telegram was sent
off without delay and the answer came back: “Go
ahead. It is yours. Make yourself at home.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kemp came rushing up with the news to
Elizabeth. “Now, Elfie,” he said, “you have got
to help me and when everything is finished we will
give a tea and invite some of our friends.”</p>

<p>“How entrancing!” exclaimed Elizabeth, clasping
her hands over her breast. “Mr. Titian, you are a
gem of purest ray serene.”</p>

<p>He had fallen into her manner of speech by now
and usually matched her high-flown language by
something even more grandiloquent. “And you, my
dear Elfie,” he said, “shall be the reigning sovereign<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
of my sylvan retreat. I may as well confess to you
at the outset,” he went on, “that I am wondering
how I shall furnish my modest abode when it is put
into habitable condition.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth knitted her brows over this problem.
“I suppose you haven’t a great deal of money,”
she said hesitatingly, for she did not want to
hurt his feelings. “I am, alas, in the same impoverished
condition, but if twenty-five cents would
do you any good I will gladly add that to your
store.”</p>

<p>“Elfie, you are too much for me,” returned the
young man gravely. “Bless your dear little heart!
I don’t know anyone I would rather borrow from,
but I won’t ask you to lend yet. We will see how
well we can manage first. Of course you knew long
ago that I was not rolling in wealth. In fact, it took
my bottom dollar to get me through my trip to
Europe, but it was well worth it. I am rather resourceful
and I can manage, even if I have to sleep
on a pile of straw.”</p>

<p>This seemed poverty indeed to Elizabeth and she
determined to consult her mother about certain discarded
articles in the attic. This she did that very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
evening, but in the meantime Mr. Kemp had made
the joyous announcement of his connection with the
Gilmore family and had been accepted as something
more than an ordinary acquaintance. He had met
many of the young people and was considered a
great addition to their circle, for he was merry and
entertaining, good-tempered and thoughtful, so was
included in all social affairs of the neighborhood
and was frequently invited out to dinner; consequently
the fare at the Mansion House became less
of a grievance.</p>

<p>Therefore it happened that when Elizabeth
began to make her inquiries about the odd pieces
of cast-off furniture Kathie was ready to lend a
hand.</p>

<p>“Oh, do let him have any of that old stuff,” she
begged. “We must fix him up somehow. Probably
he will want to use it only for awhile anyhow. What
is there up there, mother?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hollins considered. “Well, let me see;
there is a table with a broken leg, two or three rickety
chairs and things of that kind. There is an old
four-poster bedstead, too, but he would hardly want
that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>“He might,” declared Kathie; “we will ask him,
anyhow.”</p>

<p>The upshot of the matter was that contributions
came in from near and far. The young people began
to be interested at once, and were eager to have a
hand in furnishing the studio, so one and another
hunted up odds and ends of furniture. The Paines
rooted out an old bureau from their attic and that
was the beginning of a collection which included a
mattress, pillows, curtains, covers, rugs, odd dishes,
and ended up with a kerosene oil stove. All these
were mounted upon a wagon and one Saturday
morning appeared a procession of young folks following
the wagon to its destination. Neal Paine,
Dick Hollins, Hal Tyson, and some others had lent
a hand toward the repairing of the old building and
were on the premises when the wagon approached.
Elizabeth, of course, was there and was the one who
first spied the troop.</p>

<p>“Look what’s coming!” she cried out.</p>

<p>The workers inside speedily rushed out, and the
goods were dumped on the ground amid much
laughter and joking. The girls insisted upon helping
to clean the rooms and worked with a will, so that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
before the day was over the little house really looked
cosey and as if it had been lived in by “somebody
besides chickens,” Elizabeth said. Thus was the
studio of Oliver Kemp established and many good
times did it see.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small><span class="smcap">The Model</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE studio soon became a most fascinating spot
to many others besides Elizabeth. Mr. Kemp
was very ingenious and had a knack of turning
commonplace things into artistic ones which were
the wonder and admiration of all his friends. A
pair of croquet mallets was transformed into high
candlesticks, a row of cracked plates made decorations
for the shelf above the door, a wash bench covered
by a rug and set off with a row of pillows looked
well on one side the room, pussywillows and strange
weeds in old stone jars were most effective against
a background of plain building paper, and so it
went. All this appealed so strongly to the little
girls that they were in danger of neglecting their
studies in order to rush out to the studio, and at
last a rule was made that they could go only once
a day and then when their lessons for the next day
were learned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>One Saturday, however, Elizabeth overstepped
the bounds. She really didn’t mean to, in the first
place, but circumstances so overcame her scruples
that she forgot.</p>

<p>After having made sketches of the three girls separately
and collectively, Mr. Kemp decided that
he must have Elizabeth to sit for the figure in a
picture he was painting. She did not particularly
enjoy being a model, for it was very wearisome work
to an active little body who found it very difficult
to keep perfectly still for even two minutes; when
it came to twenty or more on a stretch it was next
to impossible. Yet for the sake of an excuse to
go to the studio she was willing to undergo the
martyrdom.</p>

<p>On this special Saturday she hurried off very soon
after breakfast with the intention of studying her
lessons in the afternoon. She had begged her mother
to allow her to break the rule just this once, “Because,”
she said, “Mr. Kemp says the light is much
better in the morning, and besides he is in a hurry
to get this particular picture done, for he may have
a chance to sell it.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” replied her mother, “for this once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
you may set aside the rule, but come back at noon,
Elizabeth.”</p>

<p>The child did not wait for the last words but was
off like a shot. It was a cool, cloudy morning, robins
and bluebirds carolling from the tree-tops, and in the
fields green grass pushing through the moist earth.
“Pretty soon there will be violets,” said Elizabeth
to herself. She stopped to gather some yellow daffodils
from the flower border and bore them with her,
singing as she went along, “Daffy-down-dilly came
up in the cold.” When she reached the door of the
studio she paused to lift the knocker and to pound
it hard against the piece of metal beneath it. The
knocker was one of Mr. Kemp’s latest contrivances
and was made of a large curtain ring fastened to an
old piece of heavy tin. It took some pounding to
bring forth much sound, but no one failed to use
this means of letting the artist know of the arrival
of a visitor.</p>

<p>At the summons Mr. Kemp came to the door with
a dish towel and a tea cup in his hand. “Why, how
nice and early you are,” he said. “I am just washing
up my breakfast things.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth laughed. It seemed funny to hear a man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
say that, although she knew Mr. Kemp prepared his
own breakfast and supper.</p>

<p>“Eggs, coffee and toast,” Mr. Kemp went on.
“Good enough for a king. By the way, Elfie, we
tried the new chimney last night and it works like
a breeze. We can have a fire in the fireplace today
if you are cold.” Having completed the rest, Mr.
Kemp and the boys were ambitious to try their
powers further and had built a stone chimney on
the outside of the small building, thereby adding
much to its appearance, both inside and out.</p>

<p>“Did you cook your breakfast over a fire on the
hearth?” asked Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“No, I was too lazy to make it, so I used the oil
stove. One can really toast quite well over it. I’ll
be ready as soon as I put this cup away.” He went
back into the pantry while Elizabeth busied herself
in placing the daffodils in a ginger jar.</p>

<p>“Fine,” exclaimed Mr. Kemp when he came back.
“It brings sunlight right into the room, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I always think of daffys as cups of sunshine,”
returned Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“I might have known you would; it sounds just
like you,” responded the artist as he busied himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
with setting his palette. “I think I must paint a
picture of you and the daffys in a strong sunlight.
It could be made something stunning.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth sighed. She really hoped that when
this picture was done Mr. Kemp would think he
had had enough of a little girl with Titian hair, but
it was evident that he would keep on indefinitely
and, like many another, he didn’t seem in the least
to realize that it might be a hardship, so intent was
he upon making the studies. Most of the girls, the
older as well as the younger, thought it an immense
compliment to be asked to sit to the painter, but
Elizabeth had come to learn that it was not always
so. Some combination of light and shade, some
special effect, was what was considered, rather than
a question of beauty. Why, had she not seen Mr.
Kemp painting very ugly old women and uglier old
men?</p>

<p>The morning passed slowly, although it must be
said that Mr. Kemp was good company and did
his best to entertain his little sitter. About eleven
o’clock the threatening clouds dissolved into rain,
which came down harder and harder.</p>

<p>“It’s coming down with a vengeance, isn’t it?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
said Mr. Kemp, stepping back from his easel and
looking at his work contemplatively. Then he put
down his palette and went to the window to look
out. “I say, Elfie,” he said, “let’s have dinner here.
I’m not going to risk my sweet self out in this rain.
I’ll build up a good fire and we will cook some potatoes
in the ashes. Let me see what is in the larder.
Come on.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth jumped down, only too glad of the diversion.
“It is too early, isn’t it?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Oh dear, no, not to roast potatoes. It takes ages
to cook them. I’ll make the fire first thing.” He
was not long in finding dry shavings and wood and
soon had a fire burning cheerily on the hearth.
“Now come, let’s forage,” he said. “Eggs; we’ve
plenty of those. I will make an omelette; I learned
how to do that in Paris. Here is some chipped beef
and a can of sardines. Which do you like best?”</p>

<p>“Oh, sardines,”—Elizabeth declared for these.</p>

<p>“I might make a sardine omelette; that wouldn’t
be bad, and we can open a can of soup to have first.
Do you like orange marmalade? I know there is a
lot of that; bread and butter. Milk? There should
be milk. Oh yes, here it is. I don’t believe there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
much else, except crackers and cheese. Will that
be enough?”</p>

<p>“It will be loads,” Elizabeth assured him in a
pleased voice. This was a great variety and the
novelty of it all was so delightful. The potatoes were
put in the hot embers as soon as there were any for
them and then there was a merry time over setting
the table. Dishes of various sizes, shapes and patterns
were gathered together, paper napkins were
laid, the jar of daffodils set in the middle of the rather
rickety table and they stood off to admire the effect.</p>

<p>“I call that a very stylish set-out,” declared Mr.
Kemp. “Take this fork, Elfie, and prod those potatoes
while I get to work with the other things. Where
in the world did I put that can-opener? See if you
can find it, Elfie, while I do something else.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth hunted around and at last found the
can-opener had been used to prop open one of the
windows. “What a negligible little child you are,
Mr. Titian,” she said, bringing it to him. They
met on common ground when it came to frolics like
this.</p>

<p>“So I am, Elfie. I remember now, that I couldn’t
find a stick for that foolish window. I am going to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
put some catches on after awhile, but Rome wasn’t
built in a day. What about those potatoes?”</p>

<p>“They are pretty hard yet.”</p>

<p>“They are? Mean things; and I am getting hungrier
every minute. We might forego the potatoes
and eat them later. What do you say? I don’t believe
we can wait for the slow things. Bully! Here
is a can of peas, just the things to go with the omelette.
Have you any idea what you do with them,
Elfie? Do they have to be cooked or anything?”</p>

<p>“I have seen ’Lectra pour cold water over them,”
replied Elizabeth doubtfully. “She puts them in a
colander and does that, I know; I don’t remember
whether she cooks them or not.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kemp carefully pierced a pea with a fork.
“They appear quite soft,” he announced. “I think
if we just warm them up it will do. Dear me, I
haven’t a colander. I will just wash them in a pan
and scoop them up with a spoon; I reckon that
will do.”</p>

<p>“I could do that,” Elizabeth offered.</p>

<p>“So you can. I think they will get hot while I am
making the omelette. But perhaps we’d better eat
the soup first because it will not do to let the omelette<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
stand, besides there will not be room enough
on the stove for more than two things.”</p>

<p>They decided to do this and when the soup was
hot they carried it in, one eating from a soup plate
and the other from a bowl, and making very merry
over it.</p>

<p>“I smell something burning,” cried Elizabeth, as
she was taking her last spoonful of soup.</p>

<p>“The peas!” cried Mr. Kemp. “I didn’t put any
water on them and probably they are stuck fast.”
He rushed out to the little cubby which he called
the kitchenette and, sure enough, the peas had stuck
fast. “I don’t suppose they are any good,” said
Mr. Kemp, looking at them ruefully. “They are
burnt black at the bottom.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they won’t be so bad on top, if you take
them off carefully.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kemp followed her suggestion, but after
gingerly removing the top layer and tasting it, he
declared that the taste went all the way through.
“So we’ll have to give them up as a bad job,” he
declared. “Well, at least we shall have the omelette.
I will make it big enough to make up for the peas,
only I had set my heart on those peas. I thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
how lovely it would be to make a rim of them around
the omelette, quite Frenchy, and the yellow and
green would have matched the daffodils so nicely.”</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind, we shall do very well. I don’t
mind if you don’t.”</p>

<p>While Mr. Kemp was preparing the omelette,
Elizabeth thought she might try the potatoes again,
and this time she found that they were really done.
She rushed to the kitchenette to announce her discovery.
“They are done!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“What? Who?” cried Mr. Kemp. “Why do
you come upon me in that sudden way, Elfie? I
nearly dropped the pan—and then there would be
trouble in the camp.”</p>

<p>“The potatoes,” answered Elizabeth. “I tried
them, and I am quite sure they are done, so now we
shall not mind about the peas.”</p>

<p>“I had forgotten the blessed things entirely.
Fetch them along, Elfie, but don’t burn yourself. I
have a ticklish job here in getting this precious
omelette dished. My heart is in my mouth. Don’t
watch me, there’s a good child. If I should drop it
I should be ready to weep.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth laughed and went off to take up the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
potatoes with a long fork. They were rather black
on the outside but when opened showed themselves
white and mealy within. Then they fell to enjoying
their feast to the fullest. Elizabeth thought she
had never tasted a better dinner and praised her
friend’s skill as a cook. When it was disposed of
and the dishes washed, they suddenly discovered
that it was quite late and that they had been hours
over the preparation, the eating and the clearing
up. To be sure there had been much joking and
laughing, some dilly-dallying, and all that.</p>

<p>“Dear me,” cried Elizabeth, “I had no idea how
late it was. I must go.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but it is raining so hard. You’d better wait
a few minutes,” Mr. Kemp dissuaded her.</p>

<p>It was raining very hard, and Elizabeth waited.
Mr. Kemp began telling her a fascinating tale and,
what with his interest in the telling and hers in the
listening, the moments passed unheeded until it was
finished. Then Elizabeth sprang to her feet. “It
is dark,” she cried. “Oh, Mr. Titian, I should have
gone long ago.”</p>

<p>“I will see you home, never fear,” he said. “We’ve
had a great day, Elfie, haven’t we?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>“Oh yes, we have,” she could truthfully say, but
her conscience smote her when she remembered that
she was only to spend the morning. She wondered
what excuse she could give. It had rained, to be
sure, but not steadily, and she could easily have
taken the walk, rain or no rain; but she did not voice
her thoughts to Mr. Kemp, but cheerfully trotted
along with him under an umbrella, and he left her
at her own door with a merry word of farewell.</p>

<p>Elizabeth paused for a moment in the hall after
she entered the house. She heard voices upstairs.
There was a light in the sitting-room, but no one
was there. She took off her things, hung them up,
and gathered up her school books, taking them to
the sitting-room, by the table of which she sat down.</p>

<p>Presently she heard a voice from the doorway
saying: “Elizabeth, where have you been all day?”</p>

<p>She did not look up, but answered: “At the studio,
mother.”</p>

<p>“All day? Where did you have your dinner?”</p>

<p>“We had it there, such a lovely, tasteful dinner.
Mr. Kemp and I got it ourselves.” Elizabeth tried
to be very animated and to speak as if it were a
matter of course. Her mother made no comment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
and she went on. “You see it was raining so
hard——”</p>

<p>“Not all day.”</p>

<p>“Well, it was whenever I looked out, and Mr.
Kemp invited me. He wanted to try the new chimney
and roast potatoes. It was such a big, populous
fire at first and the sparks flew out so we had to
wait till it stopped popping and there were some
red embers to put the potatoes in. They were a
long, long time roasting, though.”</p>

<p>“And after dinner?”</p>

<p>“We washed the dishes and then I was coming,
but it was raining so awfully hard just then so we
sat down by the fire and Mr. Kemp told me a lovely
narration. I was so interested in it that I didn’t
know how late it was getting, and when he had finished
I came straight home. He came with me. You
weren’t worried, were you, mother?”</p>

<p>“I was not so much worried as I was grieved to
know that you wilfully disobeyed me. I excused
you from the usual rule of getting your lessons in
the morning and you promised to study this afternoon,
yet you have just come in and it is suppertime.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>Elizabeth was silent. She knew she had done
wrong, but it was so hard to leave off when one was
having such an unusually good time. “I didn’t
mean to stay so late,” she made the excuse lamely.</p>

<p>“I think, my dear,” said her mother, “that in
order to prevent your forgetting another time, I
must forbid your going at all to the studio until I
give you permission.” Then her mother walked
away, and Elizabeth drew a long sigh as she turned
back to her books.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IF Betsy had not gone to the city with her aunt
Emily on that rainy Saturday it is doubtful if
Elizabeth had been willing to spend so long a time
at the studio. As it was, Betsy had an account of
the day’s delights, and agreed with her first best
that the game was scarcely worth the candle as it
deprived her of future visits.</p>

<p>“I suppose your mother didn’t say how long it
would be before you could go again,” said Betsy
gravely.</p>

<p>“No; that’s just it,” replied Elizabeth. “I shall
be on the tattered edge of despair for who knows
how long. Perhaps if I am very, very good she will
lift the dread decree sooner than if I were very, very
bad. Well,” Elizabeth sighed, “I suppose that those
who dance must pay the piper. It will always be a
luminous day in the almanac of my thoughts. Now
tell me, Betsy, what sort of day did you have?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>“Oh, the usual kind. We shopped all the morning
and went to the same place for lunch that we
always go, then aunt Emily called on old Miss
Peters, and we took the five o’clock train; that’s
all.”</p>

<p>“Did you get the new hat?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and the stuff for two new frocks. Miss
Cutter comes next week, you know. One of the
frocks is very pretty, I think; a challis with weentsy
blue flowers sprinkled over it. I am going to wear
blue ribbons with it.”</p>

<p>“I love blue and I can never, never wear it, Betsy,”
said Elizabeth, shaking her head mournfully.</p>

<p>“Oh well, I wouldn’t care. Maybe your children
can, or at least some of them, and that will do just
as well.”</p>

<p>“That is a very comforting thought,” returned
Elizabeth, “and you may be very sure, Betsy, that
I will treat with spurn any man with red hair who
comes to woo me.”</p>

<p>“Even if he should be a prince?” asked Betsy.</p>

<p>“Even if he were a king,” Elizabeth assured her.
“What is your hat like, Betsy? Are you going to
wear it Sunday?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>“Aunt Emily says I must keep it for Easter. It
is quite nice, yes; but nothing very grand. Shall you
get a new hat, Elizabeth?”</p>

<p>“I suppose not. We have to be very economical
this year on account of Dick’s going to college.
Mother and Kathie were looking over things yesterday,
and they thought my hat would do. Kathie
is going to retrim it with some ribbons she has. I
don’t care so very much for I seldom wear it except
to church and Sunday-school. I must try not to
take an interest in such carnial things if I am to be
very, very good.”</p>

<p>Betsy laughed. “You are so funny, Elizabeth.
I don’t think it is wicked to like nice things.”</p>

<p>“No, I suppose it isn’t if you don’t follow after
them to the seclusion of anything else.” Elizabeth
had heard her mother say something like this, although
she did not use the word seclusion. “Do
you know what I think I shall do so as to prove my
sincereness to mother; I think I shall mortify myself
for a week or more and wear only the most unbecoming
and unappropriate things. Why,”—she sat
up suddenly in pleased excitement,—“I might even
wear pink or blue.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>“Oh, I wouldn’t,” Betsy tried to dissuade her.
“I don’t think it would look a bit nice.”</p>

<p>“That is just my object. I shall be mortifying
the flesh dreadfully; and besides,” she added, “it
would give me a chance for once in my life to see
how I really did look in those colors.”</p>

<p>“But you haven’t anything blue or pink,” Betsy
reminded her.</p>

<p>“I have some old blue ribbons that Kathie gave
me for my dolls, and I might dye something. If I
made a very, very strong blueing with laundry blue
I could dip an old white waist in it and it might do.”
Elizabeth, once launched upon such an enterprise,
was eager to carry it to the fullest lengths.</p>

<p>“What would Mr. Kemp say?” Betsy asked.
“He would think you had very poor taste and were
very inartistic.”</p>

<p>“That would be part of the punishment, you see.
It would be all the better, for it was on his account
that I erred and strayed from my ways. Yes, I
think it is exactly what I must do. You don’t mind,
Betsy, if I go now and prepare my penetential robes?”
They were sitting under their big trysting-tree back
of the Tysons’ garden when this talk took place.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
“Perhaps you would like to come with me and help
dye the waist,” Elizabeth proposed, seeing that Betsy
looked dubious.</p>

<p>“Oh yes; that would be better,” agreed Betsy.
“Shall you wear blue to school tomorrow, Elizabeth?
What will Miss Jewett think?”</p>

<p>“She may not approve, but I shall be disobeying
no rules,” returned Elizabeth steadfastly. “I suppose
Corinne Barker will turn up her nose and will
make unkind remarks, but I must suffer in silence.”</p>

<p>Betsy giggled. She was well aware that all this
was play more than actual humility on the part of
Elizabeth, but it was amusing and she wanted to
see how it would turn out. She did not know of another
girl who would be so daring in the face of
established precedents.</p>

<p>“I will ask ’Lectra to press out the ribbons for
me,” said Elizabeth, as they trotted along home,
“and I shall have to ask her for the blue. I hope
she is in a good humor.”</p>

<p>They found Electra disposed to grant any favor.
The irons were on so it was no trouble to press out
the ribbons. As for the waist, Elizabeth and Betsy
preferred to try their experiments on that where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
they would be unobserved. They chose the attic
for their work, and, having prepared a basinful of
water, deeply, darkly blue, they dipped the waist in
several times and then hung it up to dry.</p>

<p>“It is lucky that it is that crêpe stuff that doesn’t
need ironing,” remarked Elizabeth as she carefully
examined her work. “It is a waist that was Kathie’s,
you know. I hope it won’t be very streaky. I wish
I had a blue skirt to go with it, but as I haven’t I
shall have to wear brown.”</p>

<p>“They won’t look very pretty together,” said
Betsy doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Am I doing this to look pretty?” inquired Elizabeth
with disdain. “Look at my hands, Betsy.
Do you suppose the blue will come off?”</p>

<p>“You will have to scrub them pretty hard,” Betsy
advised her.</p>

<p>But hard as she scrubbed there was a tinge of
blue remaining although Betsy comforted her by
saying it would wear off. “Do you suppose your
mother will consent to your wearing blue—now you
have gone to all this trouble about it?” Betsy
brought up this difficulty.</p>

<p>“Dear me, I don’t know. Well, all is, I shall make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
the experiment and take the risks.” By this time
Elizabeth had worked herself up into a state of ardent
desire to wear blue. It was the unusual which appealed
to her. It would make a small sensation and
she wouldn’t tell anyone why she did it, she said to
herself. “All I shall say when they ask me, if anyone
does,” she said to Betsy, “is: It is a vow.”</p>

<p>Fortunately for her plan, she was the first down
in the morning, and only her father appeared before
she finished breakfast. As he was not so very observant,
he did not notice the blue bows on her hair.
They were not well tied, but Betsy had promised to
give the finishing touch, and Elizabeth sped away
without a farewell to any but her father, saying that
she had promised to stop at Betsy’s very early.
Betsy was as good as her word and attended to the
bows, commenting upon Elizabeth’s appearance as
she did so. “The blue isn’t bad in one way,” she
said, “for it makes your cheeks look pinker and your
skin whiter, but—don’t get mad, Elizabeth,—it
also makes your hair look redder.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose so,” returned Elizabeth resignedly.
“I expected that, and indeed I noticed it myself.
Is the waist very streaky, Betsy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>“Why, no, not so very. It isn’t a very pretty
color, but it is real blue.”</p>

<p>“Then my purpose is accomplished,” declared
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>There were many curious glances cast in her direction
that morning. Corinne and Bess giggled as
Elizabeth knew they would and she was quite sure
that she could tell exactly what they whispered one
to another, but she bore herself gravely and did not
look the least conscious. Even Miss Jewett smiled
when she saw the prancing blue bows adorning the
ruddy locks, but Elizabeth made no sign of seeing
the smile. To all questions from the more daringly
curious she answered solemnly: “It is a vow,” and
nothing further would she say.</p>

<p>She felt very triumphant at having been able to
carry out her intention to the letter, although in her
inmost heart she perfectly well knew that the blue
bows would be ordered off instantly as soon as she
reached home. She did not flinch, however, from
the ordeal, but walked in to dinner with all the composure
of one well assured of her position.</p>

<p>“Will you look at Elizabeth?” cried Kathie as
soon as she caught sight of her costume. “You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
don’t mean to say that you have been to school in
that rig.”</p>

<p>“I certainly do,” returned Elizabeth calmly.</p>

<p>“Well, I should think you would be ashamed to
be seen in it. Mother,” she called, “do come here and
see this child. I declare, I don’t know what she will
do next. Where did you get that hideous waist? I
don’t recognize it.”</p>

<p>“You should, for it used to be yours,” returned
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“Mine? I never possessed a queer fadey blue
thing like that. Of all combinations—with those sky-blue
hair-ribbons. I don’t see what induced you to
put them together.”</p>

<p>“It was the best I could do,” Elizabeth told her.
“I had nothing blue and so I dyed the waist, and the
ribbons were on a hat of yours that you got wet.
You gave them to me for my dolls and ’Lectra pressed
them out for me.”</p>

<p>Kathie gazed at her with an expression of helpless
despair. “Mother,” she said, as Mrs. Hollins entered
the room, “do look at this child. Can you
believe she went to school dressed that way?”</p>

<p>“Why did you do so, Elizabeth?” asked her mother
quietly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>“I did it to mortify the flesh,” returned Elizabeth
defiantly, but speaking to Kathie. “I think you are
very wrong to discourage me from keeping a vow
and trying to be good. I can’t take pilgrimages and
do things like that, and you go to work and cast wet
blankets upon my holy purposes.”</p>

<p>Kathie had to laugh at the very injured expression.
“I don’t see the point yet,” she said, “but I do see
that you are the most absurd child that was ever
created. Have you an idea of what drove her to
this absurdity, mother?”</p>

<p>“I think I have, perhaps. She will tell me, I am
sure. Go on and eat your dinner, Elizabeth, and we
will see about this afterward.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth continued her meal with an air of virtuous
indignation which made her mother smile
each time she looked at her. As she had done nothing
absolutely wrong she did not deserve so much as a
scolding, though her mother did wish she could get
behind the appearance and find the real motive.
She put her arm around the child when they rose
from the table. “Suppose we go up and change
those ribbons and that waist for something more
becoming,” she whispered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>Elizabeth obediently followed, feeling reassured
and not at all disturbed.</p>

<p>“Mother would very much like to know what was
passing in that funny little mind of yours when you
put on these,” said Mrs. Hollins, as she unfastened
the startling bows. “You must have had some
motive, I am sure. Won’t you tell mother what it
was?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Elizabeth, “it began when I was
trying to think of something I could do to show you
that I wanted to be very, very good, so you would
uplift the ban that wouldn’t allow me to go to the
studio. I tried to think of some holy mortification,
and I couldn’t think of anything but to wear blue,
which you and Kathie have always told me would
make me look like a fright. I had these ribbons,
but I didn’t have any waist but this old one, and I
thought if I blued it very, very much it would do.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t the girls think you looked rather queer?”
asked her mother.</p>

<p>“Oh yes; I expected that; it was part of the holy
mortification.”</p>

<p>“Well, dear, if you thought it was such a righteous
thing to do, and one that deserved approval, why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
did you hurry off to school this morning before I
could see you?”</p>

<p>This was rather a staggering question, and Elizabeth
was silent, not knowing exactly how to answer
it.</p>

<p>“If you did what you thought was a pious act
because you wanted my approval, I can’t see why
you didn’t parade yourself before me the first thing
in the morning, so I could get the whole benefit of
it,” continued Mrs. Hollins. “’Fess up, Elizabeth.
That was not the true motive. You wanted to see
how you would look in blue.”</p>

<p>“Well, yes; I suppose that was it,” answered Elizabeth,
a little shamefacedly. “But, mother, it really
wasn’t in the beginning; only the more I thought
about it the more I wanted to do it. I have always
been crazy about blue and I thought there is the one
chance of my life, so I took it.”</p>

<p>“And are you quite satisfied?” asked her mother.</p>

<p>Elizabeth stroked lovingly the blue ribbons which
her mother had taken off. “I don’t know,” she replied.
“I do wish I could wear them again some day.
Betsy says they are becoming to my complexion,
but not to my hair.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>“I think she is right.”</p>

<p>“When I grow up,” said Elizabeth, “I think I
will go off somewhere for a whole year, somewhere
that I am a perfect stranger to everyone, and I will
dye my hair and wear blue for a whole year.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hollins laughed. “Well, honey, that would
be an idea, but now you’d better run along. You look
much more like my own little girl as you are.”</p>

<p>However, Elizabeth did not have to grow up before
she wore blue again, for when she reached home
that afternoon there was Mr. Kemp with a delightful
scheme to unfold. “My trunk full of costumes
has come,” he announced, “and I want you to come
and help me unpack.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth looked at her mother. “You may go
for a little while,” Mrs. Hollins gave permission,
“but you must be sure that she comes home before
dark, Mr. Kemp. She stayed much too long the
last time.”</p>

<p>“I give you my word that I will bring her back
before dark,” Mr. Kemp promised, and the child
went off, after giving her mother a rapturous hug
and kiss.</p>

<p>These costumes had been much talked over by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
Mr. Kemp and Elizabeth. They appealed to her
very strongly, for he had promised that she should
dress up in some of them. To wear a train, a peasant’s
dress, a Watteau costume and others quite as
picturesque, was something the child had been looking
forward to for some time. The dressing up was
not for that day, however, for there was only time
for a short survey. In the midst of this Mr. Kemp
exclaimed: “I’ll tell you what we will do, Elfie;
we’ll give some tableaux. This place is quite big
enough, and we’ll have a lot of the crowd here. We
can make pictures, you know; set a big frame over
there and pose the figures behind it. That will be
a fine way to show off my costumes and be good
fun, too.”</p>

<p>“And may I be in them?” asked Elizabeth eagerly.</p>

<p>“Well, rather,” replied Mr. Kemp.</p>

<p>“And could I wear this?” Elizabeth held up a
blond wig, “and a blue dress?”</p>

<p>Mr. Kemp laughed. Kathie had just been telling
him of Elizabeth’s “holy mortification,” to his great
entertainment. “Blue it shall be,” he declared. “I
will rig you up as a Dresden shepherdess, if I can get
hold of a proper hat, and you shall be some other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
lovely female, a portrait, maybe, by Reynolds or
Gainsborough. Oh, we’ll fix you out all right, but if
I let you wear the wig you must make a bargain that
I have my way in making a Titian of you. I’ll tell
you what, Elfie, I will be Titian painting and you
shall be the picture itself.”</p>

<p>They had a good laugh over this and, as it turned
out, the tableau was nearly spoiled because Elizabeth
could not keep her face straight with a paint brush
so very near the corner of her mouth, and Mr. Titian
looking at her so fixedly with such a quizzical
expression.</p>

<p>Everyone pronounced the pictures a great success,
but Elizabeth’s crowning joy was when she actually
wore Miss Jewett’s hat trimmed with corn-flowers
and donned a blue dress to match it; yet, strange to
say, everyone declared that she was much more lovely
in the Titian picture, although it would be some years
before she would grow into an appreciation of this
herself. After this she wore the blond wig and the
trailing blue frock many times, but never with such
perfect satisfaction as that first time.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

<small><span class="smcap">The Gray House Opens</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE tableaux were given on Easter Monday and
a few days later Elizabeth was told that her
cousins were coming back to the gray house. She
hurried off to tell Betsy, who once was jealous of
Ruth but was now her very good friend. “I wonder
who Ruth will have for her first best,” remarked
Betsy. “She used to have Bess, you know, but since
Bess has become so thick with Corinne perhaps she
won’t.”</p>

<p>“Bess doesn’t go with Corinne near so much as
she did,” Elizabeth assured her, “besides, Corinne
will be going back home soon.”</p>

<p>“And I hope she’ll stay there,” returned Betsy
fervently.</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow,” said Elizabeth, “we will not let
Ruth think we don’t want her with us, will we,
Betsy?”</p>

<p>“Of course not. I am very fond of Ruth and we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
three can play together whether Bess joins us or
not. I wish we could do something as a sort of welcome
for Ruth. Can’t you think of something,
Elizabeth?”</p>

<p>Elizabeth proposed several plans, but all were too
elaborate or impossible. “I will tell you what we
can do,” she said at last. “We can dress up like
old beggar women. We will bend over and take
sticks to walk with, and baskets. We will sneak
around the back way and when we hear Ruth coming
we will ask for food in a whining voice and suddenly
we will throw off the disguise and appear in
our true characters.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I think that will be fine,” cried Betsy, well
pleased with the idea. “It will be such a surprise.
What can we wear as a disguise, Elizabeth?”</p>

<p>“We ought to have rags, I suppose, but maybe
we can root out some old skirts or petticoats. One
of us could wear a shawl over her head and the other
could find something like a big handkerchief. We
must bring them ’way over our faces so we cannot
be recognized.” They were quite enraptured with
their plan, Elizabeth promising to let Betsy know
just as soon as the Gilmore family had returned, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
the two parted, arranging to meet at a certain chosen
spot.</p>

<p>The next day, when Elizabeth came home at noon
she heard that her cousins would arrive about two
o’clock, but her mother did not think it worth while
for her to stay at home to see them. “You can go
right up after school this afternoon,” she said, and
Elizabeth was satisfied, the more so that Betsy would
be free to help her carry out her plan of surprising
Ruth.</p>

<p>Each girl had taken her bundle of poverty-stricken
clothes and had carried it to the hollow trysting-tree.
This being in a most secluded spot, they were not
observed when they changed their appearance and
assumed the characters of old women.</p>

<p>“You look so funny,” giggled Betsy when Elizabeth,
in a much stained and faded skirt of Electra’s,
an old worsted shawl, and a battered felt hat tied
down over her ears, announced that she was ready
and how did she look.</p>

<p>Betsy was more respectable in a cast-off skirt of
Elizabeth’s, a black shawl over her head, and a basket
on her arm. Being shorter than her comrade,
the skirt reached to her ankles, but instead of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
own neat shoes she displayed an old pair of Kathie’s
which Elizabeth had found in the attic. The skirt
which Elizabeth wore was sufficiently long to cover
her feet, but she had chosen her oldest shoes to wear.</p>

<p>Taking a circuitous route, the two stole around the
back way and approached the rear of the house
where they could take a survey, hiding behind the
grape arbor and peeping out from time to time.</p>

<p>“I see cousin Belle on the front porch,” Elizabeth
at last whispered, after making a tour of investigation.
“Grandpa Gil is there, too, and Cousin Tom
went down toward the studio. There comes Ruth
now, Betsy. She is probably going down to the
spring. Hide, hide, Betsy, and when we hear footsteps
we will walk out and confront her. It will
have to be she for there is no one else, for I can see
both maids in the kitchen and Martin is down at
the garage.” All this in hurried whispers.</p>

<p>The two would-be beggars sprang back behind the
grape arbor which ran along the side of the hill and
opened upon the path which led to the spring. They
waited, and presently heard footsteps enter the grape
arbor. They did not dare to look, but cowered behind
a low evergreen bush which stood at the end of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
arbor. The footsteps came nearer and nearer.
“She is walking rather slowly,” whispered Elizabeth,
“but I think we may appear now.” She stepped
out from her hiding-place, Betsy following. With
heads bent and faces well obscured they began to
whine: “Please help two poor unfortunates.”</p>

<p>“Go away with you,” a peremptory voice said,
not Ruth’s, by any means. “What are you doing
here? Don’t you know you are trespassing upon
private property?”</p>

<p>The two little girls gave one scared look and beheld
the tall form of a perfectly strange elderly lady,
whom neither had ever seen before. Betsy stepped
back hastily; Elizabeth followed suit. She stumbled
against Betsy. They both lost footing on the slippery
side of the hill and went rolling over and over
down the incline. The lady at the top of the hill
looked after them, not able to restrain a laugh. It
was so comical to see two such queer-looking creatures
tumbling over one another and looking like
some absurd moving picture. But in a moment the
observer began to be alarmed lest the two were
injured by their fall, and she called out to them:
“Are you hurt?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>To her amazement a childish voice answered: “Oh
no; we’re not a bit hurt; only shaken up a little,”
and a childish face peeped up at her from a mass of
copper-colored hair.</p>

<p>“Bless my soul!” exclaimed the lady. She stood
still for a moment and then walked quickly toward
the house.</p>

<p>Having reached the foot of the hill the two girls
gathered themselves together and sat up. Elizabeth’s
hat hung on the back of her head, her worsted
shawl had been dragged off by the weeds, while
Betsy’s shawl trailed along the ground behind
her.</p>

<p>“Well,” exclaimed Betsy, “that was a surprise,
sure enough.”</p>

<p>“And we gave it to ourselves,” returned Elizabeth;
then the humor of the situation overcame them
and they rocked with mirthful laughter.</p>

<p>When the first fit of merriment was over Elizabeth,
rubbing her knees, asked, “Are you hurt at
all, Betsy?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so, for my shawl saved me,” replied
Betsy, after feeling various parts of her body;
“It rolled me up like a mummy at first, then it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
caught in some briars and unrolled just before we
stopped.”</p>

<p>“My knees and elbows got pretty well bumped,”
Elizabeth continued to rub them, “but otherwise I
am quite sound. Who in the world do you suppose
that was, Betsy? I never was so astonished in my
life as when I heard that voice.” Then they both
went off again into peals of laughter.</p>

<p>When they had sobered down they consulted as
to what should next be done. “We can’t sit here all
day,” said Elizabeth, “and we haven’t seen Ruth
at all. I think we’d better take off our disguise, roll
the things up and hide them in that fence corner,
and then go around by the front way and say noththing
about this till we have to. Of course, we will
explain as soon as we get a good chance, but at first
we needn’t.”</p>

<p>“I think that will be best,” agreed Betsy. “It is
lucky I put on the old shoes over my own, or I
shouldn’t be in a state to see anyone.”</p>

<p>“My shoes look pretty bad,” said Elizabeth, contemplating
the worn toes, “but I shall have to make
them do, for I don’t want to go all the way home.”</p>

<p>“Oh, they’ll do.” Betsy viewed them. “They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
aren’t any worse than the last time you wore them,
you know.”</p>

<p>“And I did wear them to school that last time,”
Elizabeth remembered. “Well, come on, let us go
over and invest ourselves of these incumbrances,
and then we will go and see Ruth.”</p>

<p>They ran along to the fence corner, made a bundle
of the superfluous clothes, and then proceeded decorously
along the road which led to the gray house.
They found the family sitting on the porch, waiting
for their trunks to arrive. The maids were busy
inside setting things to rights, but there was no sign
of the lady whom they had encountered a short
time before. Ruth ran out joyously to meet them.
“I have been watching for you,” she said, “for I
knew you would come soon.” Then followed many
embraces and inquiries after the health of one and
another; then Mrs. Gilmore, Grandpa Gil, and
cousin Tom must be greeted. Still no sign of the
strange lady.</p>

<p>“Ruth will come to school with us for the rest of
the year, won’t she, Cousin Belle,” Elizabeth had
just asked when a voice from the doorway interrupted
the answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>“That’s one of them; I’d know that red head anywhere.
Those are the children who scared me nearly
out of my wits. With my weak heart it is a wonder
I didn’t collapse on the spot. Who are the little
wretches, Isabel?”</p>

<p>Everyone was speechless as the lady stepped out
on the porch. Then cousin Belle found voice to
say: “These? Why this,”—she laid her hand on
Elizabeth’s arm,—“this is Kate Hollins’s little girl
Elizabeth, and the other one is our little friend Betsy
Tyson. Come out, aunt Eunice, won’t you?”</p>

<p>The lady glared first at Elizabeth and then at
Betsy. “They are the identical children, I tell you,”
she said, stepping out upon the porch. “What did
they mean by trying to scare me,—a person of my
years? I hate practical jokes and practical jokers.”</p>

<p>“We didn’t mean—” began Elizabeth timidly,
“we didn’t want to scare anyone——”</p>

<p>“Then why did you do it?” snapped out the irate
lady.</p>

<p>Elizabeth looked helplessly at Betsy, who hung
her head and appeared very much crestfallen.</p>

<p>Grandpa Gil stretched out a kindly hand to Elizabeth.
“Come here, my dear,” he said, “and tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
us how it all happened. I can’t quite make out what
the trouble is.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth went over to her old friend, who put
his arm around her and drew her close. “Miss
Darby was alarmed at somebody or something in
the garden——”</p>

<p>“Indeed, I was,” interrupted Miss Darby, who
sat rigidly near by. “It came near bringing on an
attack. I had to go in and take some drops. Fortunately
I never travel without them.”</p>

<p>“We had no idea it was anyone we didn’t know,”
began Elizabeth. “We thought it was Ruth.”</p>

<p>“A pretty tale,” sniffed Miss Darby. “Much I
look like Ruth.”</p>

<p>“We didn’t see who it was, for we covered our
faces,”—Elizabeth turned to Mr. Gilmore with the
explanation. “We were hiding behind the evergreen
bush and when we heard footsteps we thought
they were Ruth’s.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” Miss Darby gave a scornful exclamation.</p>

<p>Grandpa Gil looked puzzled. “Still I don’t understand
just what happened,” he said. “Suppose you
begin at the beginning, my dear.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>“Well,”—Elizabeth felt emboldened to tell the
whole story,—“we wanted to do something to welcome
Ruth, and we couldn’t think of anything really
nice, but we thought it would be funny if we dressed
up like two old beggar women and lay in wait for her,
then when we had whined out our beseechment we
would suddenly throw off our disguise and stand
before her in our true characters.”</p>

<p>“And when we saw a perfect stranger,” put in
Betsy, “we were the ones who were surprised and
scared. We were so taken aback that we rolled all
the way down hill.”</p>

<p>“But we weren’t hurt,” Elizabeth took care to
assure them all. “I bruised and scraped my elbows
and knees a little, but that was all.”</p>

<p>“Quite what you might expect in playing a practical
joke,” remarked Miss Darby. “I hate practical
jokes,” she repeated.</p>

<p>“I cannot see that they really intended any harm,”
said Mr. Gilmore mildly.</p>

<p>“Whether they intended it or not they did
enough,” returned Miss Darby, still refusing to be
mollified. “I never knew a red-headed person yet
that wasn’t mischievous and unruly. Where did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
she get that red hair, anyhow? I am sure there is
none in our family. It must come from her father’s
side of the house.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth cast a deprecating look at her cousin
Belle, who put in a good word. “We all admire
Elizabeth’s hair very much, aunt Eunice, and we are
very fond of her.”</p>

<p>Aunt Eunice looked at Elizabeth as much as to
say that she was far from agreeing with this remark,
and to Elizabeth’s indignation said: “I am sorry
Kate hasn’t shown better judgment in bringing up
her children. I imagined that she was a good and
careful mother.”</p>

<p>This was too much for Elizabeth. She was quick-tempered
when suddenly aroused, and now she did
not hesitate to speak her mind. “You can say what
you please about me,” she said, turning to Miss
Darby, “whether it is true or not; but I will thank
you to know that my mother is the best in the world,
and I am not going to listen to a word against her
from you or anybody else.” Then, bursting into a
passion of tears, she broke away from Grandpa Gil
and rushed off, leaving Betsy to follow.</p>

<p>“My, what a little spitfire,” exclaimed Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
Darby. “I certainly don’t want to have the bringing
up of that child. I haven’t a doubt but poor
Kate has her hands full.”</p>

<p>“You certainly have rubbed her the wrong way,
aunt Eunice,” declared Mrs. Gilmore. “She is one
of the dearest and sweetest children in the world,
as a general thing. She is full of fancies and whims,
but she is as straightforward and conscientious as
even you could wish. I don’t know of another whom
I prefer for a companion to Ruth.”</p>

<p>“You must be greatly prejudiced,” insisted Miss
Darby. “I certainly hope she will keep out of my
sight while I am here.”</p>

<p>Betsy, more self-controlled than Elizabeth, bit her
lip to keep from speaking her mind also. Her heart
swelled within her at such criticism of her dear
Elizabeth. She could scarcely keep back the tears
as she said: “Mrs. Gilmore, I think I must go.
Good-bye, Ruth. Be sure to come to see me very
soon.” Then, with a dignified little bow, she turned
away, determining to seek out the abused Elizabeth
and pour the balm of consolation upon her bruised
heart.</p>

<p>She found her friend in the arms of her mother,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
sobbing out the tale of her woes. Betsy joined in
giving the indignant recital all its value.</p>

<p>“Dear, dear,” murmured Mrs. Hollins; “this is
most unfortunate. I am afraid you have gained
aunt Eunice’s ill-will. She is very strong in her prejudices
and opinions, although a very good woman.”</p>

<p>“Is she your aunt, too, Mrs. Hollins?” asked
Betsy.</p>

<p>“Yes, she is my father’s sister, although I have
seen but little of her. She was spending the winter
in Florida at the same time that cousin Belle was
and was persuaded to come up and make a visit
before going to her home in western New York.”</p>

<p>“I wish she hadn’t been persuaded,” sighed
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“Under the circumstances I do, too. She is a
really kind and charitable woman, doing much good
in charity work, but once convinced that her way of
thinking is right it is almost impossible to alter her
opinion.”</p>

<p>“Well, I shall certainly keep out of her way when
she comes here,” said Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“You can come to our house,” Betsy spoke. “You
know we are always glad to have you. Uncle Rob<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
is devoted to you, and aunt Emily likes you, too; I
know she does.”</p>

<p>This was comforting to hear, for to be actually
disliked by anyone was a novel experience for Elizabeth.
With the exception of Corinne Barker, she
did not know of another who felt toward her as did
this hitherto unknown aunt. “I am awfully sorry
your aunt doesn’t like me, mother,” she said.</p>

<p>“She is your aunt, too, dear, your great-aunt. I
am sorry, myself, for I should like her to be fond of
myself and my children.”</p>

<p>“Do you think she should have talked in that horrid
way, and did we do anything so very bad?”</p>

<p>“No, I cannot say that you did. It is merely
unfortunate that she happened to come along just
when she did.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t stand her saying such mean, mean
things about you,” Elizabeth went on. “I don’t
care who she is, I despise her for it. Wasn’t I right
to stand up for my ownest mother?” Elizabeth
gave her mother a close embrace.</p>

<p>“You were right to stand up for your mother, yes;
but I think maybe you could have done so in a less
offensive manner. I don’t suppose one should expect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
little girls to be so very dignified under such
circumstances, but I think if you had said less it
would have been wiser.” It is hard to chide a daughter
for the defence of her mother, and Mrs. Hollins
wanted to be just and at the same time kind. “Don’t
say that you despise aunt Eunice,” she went on.
“When you know her better you may like her very
much. She was excited and nervous and probably
did not realize what she was saying. She is not used
to children except in a general way, and their little
pranks she takes too seriously, perhaps. She is
kindness itself where poor orphaned children are
concerned and does great work for the institutions
where they are placed, so you can see that she has
really a kind heart in spite of her seeming anger.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth sighed. It was very hard to adjust
matters in this contradictory world, and she went
off with Betsy, both of them much disturbed by the
outcome of their surprise.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

<small><span class="smcap">Mrs. McGonigle’s Babies</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN spite of the fact that aunt Eunice took little
notice of her when she came to the house or
when Elizabeth saw her at her cousins’, Elizabeth’s
resentment waned rather than increased, for Miss
Darby was pleased to speak approvingly of Kathie,
seemed charmed with Babs, and behaved very generously
and affectionately toward their mother.
More than once, off in a corner, Elizabeth listened to
harrowing tales of orphaned children whom aunt
Eunice had befriended and gradually a certain respect
for the nervous, irritable woman was fostered.
After that first day, she never referred to the practical
joke, as she had named it, but she had a way
of looking over Elizabeth’s head as if she did not
see her, and of changing the subject whenever anything
was mentioned in which Elizabeth was concerned,
so that the child felt herself still disliked.
However, there were yet dear Miss Jewett and Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
Kemp who cared much for her, and excepting when
Kathie dilated upon aunt Eunice’s virtues and generosity,
Elizabeth thought little about her. She had
invited Kathie to visit her the following winter,
promising a good time in the city where she had her
home, and insisting that her visitor should be at no
expense.</p>

<p>“Of course I would love to go,” Elizabeth overheard
Kathie saying to her mother, “for aunt Eunice
says I may join any class I choose at her expense. I
could study music, or drawing, or languages, and it
would be a great advantage to me.”</p>

<p>“It is certainly an opportunity for you, dear, and
I think you should take it,” her mother replied.</p>

<p>“But there is the school,” said Kathie, after a short
silence. “I am sure that I can have it if I apply,
and then I could pay Elizabeth’s way at the Academy;
she really should go next year. Miss Jewett
will be married in June, and it would be much better
that Elizabeth should change her school.”</p>

<p>“All that is true,” agreed Mrs. Hollins. “Perhaps
we can manage, Kathie, although Dick’s college
expenses keep us pretty short. The dear boy
does his best to keep them down, but when all is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
said they do mount up. If you go to aunt Eunice
you must have a few new things, for I cannot bear
to have you go off with only what you have. You
didn’t get a new suit last winter and must have one
this.”</p>

<p>“I think, then, that I shall certainly have to give
up the visit,” said Kathie. “I won’t put you and
father to any greater expense, that is certain.”</p>

<p>“Well,” returned Mrs. Hollins, “winter is a long
way off, and who knows what may happen before
then? If only aunt Eunice had taken a fancy to
Elizabeth,” she added, after a pause, “I am sure
she would take an interest in the child’s education.”</p>

<p>“Oh well, we won’t borrow trouble, for, as you say,
winter is a long way off,” Kathie responded.</p>

<p>She walked away humming cheerfully. Elizabeth,
curled up in her chair, sighed. “The old question
again,” she said to herself. “I wish I could do something.”
She realized that it was within aunt Eunice’s
power to make things a little easier for her mother
and that any help she might be inclined to give would
not be refused, for cousin Belle and Mrs. Hollins
were her nearest of kin, and naturally need have no
compunctions about taking gifts. To be sure, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
Gilmores did not have to be considered, for there
was Grandpa Gil always ready to do for them, but
Mr. Hollins had no such person to lighten his family
burdens. He always maintained that he was glad
enough that he was under obligations to no one,
that they were happier in their moderate circumstances
than most wealthier persons, yet—Elizabeth
sat busily thinking for some time, then she
made a sudden bounce from her chair and hurried
off to Betsy.</p>

<p>She found this young person in her garden, for
it was high time to think of future flowers. Betsy,
on her knees, was planting seeds. “Have you most
finished?” asked Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“Yes, I have only the rest of this paper to put in.
These are all zinnias in this bed. They make such
a show and don’t require any attention. Have you
made a garden yet, Elizabeth?”</p>

<p>“A sort of one, but I have weightier subjects to
consider than gardens just now.”</p>

<p>Betsy got up, brushed the earth from her hands,
and picked up her trowel. “What?” she asked
concisely.</p>

<p>But Elizabeth’s thoughts had flown ahead of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
remark. “Which would you rather, that aunt Eunice
liked you or didn’t like you?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Why, I suppose I’d rather she liked me; it isn’t
pleasant to have people dislike you.”</p>

<p>“That is just what I think,” returned Elizabeth.
“Mother and father think it is horrid to try to please
people for just what you can get out of them, but
there are circumstances when it seems to me that
we ought to overcome repugniance if we can. Aunt
Eunice is really a very good woman, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is what aunt Emily says, and Mrs.
Lynde; they think she is fine. It is a dreadful pity,
Elizabeth, that we were so unlucky that day she
came.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that was most misfortunate,—I mean unfortunate;
’Lectra says misfortunate, and mother
says it isn’t correct. Well, Betsy, are you ready to
do something to gain the approbation of the honorable
Miss Darby? I am.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Well, you know she is much interested in doing
charity things, for the poor, poor babies, especially,
so I thought if we went down to Mrs. McGonigle’s
and told her we would take care of the twins this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
afternoon, we could display our charitable interests
to aunt Eunice, and she might stop just looking over
the tops of our heads.”</p>

<p>Betsy looked doubtful. “They are such dirty,
smelly babies,” she said. “They always smell sour
and as if their clothes hadn’t been washed in ages
and ages.”</p>

<p>“I know; but I suppose that is generally the way
with poor babies whose mothers don’t have time to
attend to them properly. We could bathe them
ourselves, but I suppose it wouldn’t do to wash their
clothes, for we have nothing we could put on while
theirs were drying.” Elizabeth would not have
hesitated at the undertaking, given the change of
clothes.</p>

<p>Betsy, who had taken to heart the fact that her
usually popular Elizabeth was scorned by the
haughty lady with white hair and majestic mien,
was ready to do anything which might establish her
friend in aunt Eunice’s good graces, so the two set
off for Mrs. McGonigle’s rickety house. It was not
a specially attractive place to the girls, although
Bert usually found it so, as for some reason he preferred
the society of Patsy McGonigle to that of any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
other of his schoolmates. Mrs. McGonigle took in
washing, and there was always a queer, steamy smell
arising from suds and wet clothes. There was, too,
always a baby; just now there were two, the twins
of whom Elizabeth had spoken.</p>

<p>Mrs. McGonigle, bending over her wash-tubs,
looked up as the little girls entered and made their
request to be allowed to take the babies for an airing.
“Hear to that now,” she cried in a hearty voice.
“Glory be to Peter, but I’ll not be refusin’ such a
little thing as that. Will I let ’em go? I will then,
and be thankful to yez for takin’ the pair ’av ’em
offen me hands. Me husband, pore, weakly sowl
that he is, has been ailin’ more than usual, an’ I’ve
me hands full without watchin’ the little wans.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth and Betsy did not stand upon further
ceremony, but each picked up a blue-eyed wondering
baby and took it on her lap.</p>

<p>Mrs. McGonigle stripped her hands of suds and
remarked: “I’d better be givin’ thim a sup before
they go, so they’ll not be gittin’ hungry the while
and be onaisy.”</p>

<p>The girls thought this a good plan and yielded up
their charges to be fed. When they had had their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
fill Mrs. McGonigle produced two much soiled
worsted shawls in which the babies were wrapped.
“There, now,” exclaimed the mother, “they’ll be
as warm as if they was in St. Peter’s pocket, the
darlin’s. If they do be onaisy or cryin’ ye’ll be
bringin’ thim home, young ladies.”</p>

<p>The girls promised and bore off the babies, the
mother watching them with pride, pleased that they
should want her babies and yet quite satisfied that
two such attractive infants as hers must naturally
be desirable.</p>

<p>The two girls toiled up the street with their unaccustomed
burdens. Presently Betsy stopped.
“Mine’s getting pretty heavy,” she said.</p>

<p>“So is mine,” returned Elizabeth. “We might
have brought them in a little cart or something, but
I thought it would look so much more,—more,—intimate
to carry them.”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course,” returned Betsy doubtfully;
“but though they are good little things, I wouldn’t
mind if mine were a little further away from my
nose.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth laughed, but she had to stand still in
order to do it,—the extra exertion of carrying the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
baby at the same time was a little too much for
her powers.</p>

<p>“I think I will sit down on this stone,” said Betsy,
“for, although my baby isn’t as big as yours, it
does seem as if it would weigh a ton before we reached
your cousin’s house.”</p>

<p>“I tell you what I will do,”—Elizabeth had a plan;
“if you can look after both babies for a few minutes,
I will go home and bring back Babs’s baby carriage;
she doesn’t use it any more, and it is in the wood-house
where I can easily get it; then we can take the
babies in it as far as our house and will only have to
carry them the rest of the way. We can take them
all the way back to Mrs. McGonigle’s in the carriage,
too.”</p>

<p>Betsy thought this an excellent plan, and agreed
to look after both babies. “I don’t see why I can’t
do it as well as Maggie McGonigle,” she said, “for
she is only eight years old.”</p>

<p>So, leaving Betsy with the babies both hunched
up on her lap as she sat on the big flat stone by the
way, Elizabeth sped home and soon returned with
the carriage. The babies were both lifted in and
the two self-instituted nursemaids cheerfully pushed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
it along. Having reached the lower gate of the
Hollins place, they pushed the carriage inside and
then took up their burdens again. “I’m thankful
we didn’t have to carry them all the way,” sighed
Betsy. “My arm would have been broken before
now. I don’t see how Maggie McGonigle stands
lugging babies around.”</p>

<p>“Where was she this afternoon, I wonder,” said
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“Oh, I think I saw her with the next oldest ones
out in the yard when we were there. There is one
just walking and another a little bigger, you know.
Here, Josie, you musn’t chew that dirty shawl!”
She removed the end of shawl from the baby’s
mouth and instantly the child set up a wail.</p>

<p>“Oh dear, if they begin to cry I don’t know what
we shall do,” said Elizabeth. “I believe Jo is thinking
of it; somehow he looks as if he were. Here, Jo,
see the pretty flowers. Jumpity, jumpity, jump!”
She tried to distract the baby’s attention, but was
only partially successful, for he continued to fret
while his small sister’s wail increased in volume
until it reached the ears of a lady walking in the garden
of the gray house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>She came to the fence and looked over. This time
she did not fix her gaze above the heads of the two
little girls, but she gave no sign of recognition.
“What babies are those?” she asked.</p>

<p>“They are Mrs. McGonigle’s,” answered Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“Who is she?”</p>

<p>“Well, she washes for us,” returned Elizabeth.
“She lives in that little white house near the blacksmith’s
shop. She is very poor, and has a great
many children. Her husband is a poor weakly
soul.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” Miss Darby gave the exclamation
in her scornful way. “Bring the babies over here,”
she ordered.</p>

<p>The two little girls lugged their charges over to
the fence, where Miss Darby viewed them critically.
“They are very dirty,” she said disgustedly. “Will
you tell me what you are doing with them away up
here?”</p>

<p>“We thought we would take them for a walk,”
said Betsy. “Their mother is washing, and we
thought it would be doing good to help her.”</p>

<p>A quizzical look came into Miss Darby’s eyes. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
think in your case charity should begin at home,”
she said. “I never touch the babies at our Home
till the nurses have given them a good bath and have
made them perfectly clean. You might contract
anything, any sort of disease. Those old filthy
shawls are probably reeking with germs. I would
advise you to take the babies back to their mother
and then go home and change your clothes. I hope
neither of you will venture near Ruth till you have
done so.”</p>

<p>Meekly the two little girls walked away. Their
sacrifice had brought them blame instead of praise,
and they felt quite downcast. Neither spoke for
some time, then Elizabeth said: “Well, at least she
spoke to us and looked at us as if we were human
beings and not beetles or caterpillars.”</p>

<p>This remark broke up regrets and the two laughed;
then, having reached the waiting baby carriage, the
twins were snugly tucked in and were cheerfully
wheeled home to their mother.</p>

<p>As for Miss Darby, she returned to the house and,
finding Grandpa Gil on the porch, began to tell him
of the sight she had just seen. “I declare, that
Elizabeth of Kate’s is the oddest child,” she began.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
“What do you suppose I just caught her and that
Tyson girl doing?”</p>

<p>“Nothing very bad, I hope,” returned Grandpa
Gil.</p>

<p>“Well, no, not bad exactly, but extremely imprudent.
They had borrowed two remarkably dirty
little babies, and were taking them out for a walk. I
hope they will not be seized with any disease from
contact with such filth. I warned them to go home
immediately and change their clothes.”</p>

<p>A smile came over Grandpa Gil’s face. He felt
sure that Elizabeth had some motive beyond what
appeared, and the next time he and she were alone
he began to question her. “I hear you and Betsy
were parading around with two borrowed babies,
the other day,” he began. “Did you want live dolls
to play with, and were those the only ones you could
get?”</p>

<p>“Well, it wasn’t exactly that,” replied Elizabeth.
“We didn’t do it to make a play of it, for it was
really very hard work, but we did do it for a good
cause.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you couldn’t tell without divulging a
secret. We have had a great many secrets, you and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
I, Elizabeth, and I think I can keep one pretty well.
Can’t you tell me?”</p>

<p>Elizabeth was silent for a moment. She did not
know exactly how to explain, but it was quite true
that if she could tell anyone it would be Grandpa
Gil, who was such a friend and who always took her
confidences in just the right spirit. “Well, you see,”
she started by saying, “aunt Eunice dislikes me very
much, and my mother is sorry and so is Kathie.
They would like to have her like me because she
might—now please don’t breathe a word of this,
Grandpa Gil, for this is the secretest part of the
secret——”</p>

<p>“I promise solemnly on my honor as a gentleman,
that I will keep the secret inviolate,” said Grandpa
Gil, with a slight flicker of a smile.</p>

<p>The words sounded a little familiar to Elizabeth,
but she was satisfied with the promise, and went on:</p>

<p>“You see she has no nearer relations than mother
and cousin Belle, and she is really quite good and
generous to most people and I heard mother and
Kathie talking about how nice it would be if she
had only taken a fancy to me and could help with
my education.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>Grandpa Gil was listening attentively.</p>

<p>“You know father isn’t so very, very rich. I don’t
mean that we don’t have loads to eat and quantities
of fuel to keep us warm and more clothes than we
can wear, but it is when the educations come that
there isn’t quite enough. You see Dick is going to
college and if I have to go to the Academy at the
same time, somebody might have to get left and of
course it would be me. Kathie thought she could
help out by taking the school here next year,—Miss
Jewett is going to be married, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. Go on, my dear; I am interested
in all you are telling me.”</p>

<p>“So, you see,” Elizabeth continued, “that would
be all right, for when my turn came I could teach
and send Babs to the Academy while Bert goes to
college. But, what do you think? Aunt Eunice has
invited Kathie to spend next winter with her and
wants to give her lessons in anything she likes, and
if she goes where will I be? And if she doesn’t go,
I shall feel like a pig for keeping her at home on my
account. That’s the secret, Grandpa Gil.”</p>

<p>“I understand; but I still fail to see where the
babies come in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>“Oh, I forgot; I didn’t finish about aunt Eunice.
You know I thought she was very much interested
in poor babies, and I thought if she believed I was
interested in them, too, she might begin to take more
notice of me. She did look right at me and not over
my head, but she somehow didn’t approve of the
McGonigle babies. I wonder if she approves of all
the babies she helps.”</p>

<p>Grandpa Gil smiled and shook his head. “We
won’t inquire into that, but I should like you to see,
my dear little girl, that when persons do things for
a self-interested reason they do not always make the
impression they wish. If you had really played nurse
for Mrs. McGonigle because you thought only of
helping her, you would not have come so far from
home, would you?”</p>

<p>“No, I suppose not.”</p>

<p>“And do you think your parents would like you
to try to win favor from your aunt Eunice by pretending?”</p>

<p>“Oh dear; I see I was all wrong, Grandpa Gil.
Mother and father would just hate me to do anything
like that, and they would hate to have anything
done for me that there was any slyness in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
getting. I am sure of that. Father hates anything
of that kind.”</p>

<p>“I am very sure of that, and that is why I am
showing you that you took the wrong way to win
your aunt Eunice’s favor. I hope some day she
will overcome her prejudice in your direction, and
when she does you will be glad that it is because
you have been your honest, straightforward self and
have been a good girl because it is right and lovely
to be good and not because there is any material
gain to be had from it.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth looked very sober; but there was a wistful
look in her face, too, and Grandpa Gil understood
what she was thinking. “I am sure that
your main motive was to please your father and
mother,” he went on, “and to help them and your
sister, but I wouldn’t try to do grown-up things
before you are able. Do the best you can, and
maybe things will come out better than they promise
now.”</p>

<p>“That is just what mother told Kathie.” Elizabeth
brightened up. “You are very encourageful,
Grandpa Gil. I feel ever so much better and I
won’t borrow the McGonigle babies any more,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
neither will Betsy.” This ended the conversation,
but its effect was lasting.</p>

<p>Grandpa Gil sat for some time lost in thought.
After awhile he called Miller to bring around the
motor car. When it came, he went off without asking
anyone to go with him. He stopped at Miss
Dunbar’s, went in and presently came out with
Miss Jewett. The two were in earnest conversation.
When the car started off again it turned into the
road which led to the Academy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<small><span class="smcap">Wedding Gifts</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MR. KEMP had gone off on a sketching trip
with some of his former fellow students. The
studio was closed for the time being. Elizabeth, particularly,
missed the figure of her friend swinging
along the road, hat off, sketch box in evidence. He
always gave a cheery call as he passed, and his merry
whistle was heard long after he had gone by. It
still wanted nearly two months before the close of
school, but Miss Jewett’s wedding was already talked
of, and the new house next to Miss Dunbar’s was
almost finished. Nothing gave Elizabeth and Betsy
more pleasure than to visit this future home of their
teacher. Betsy felt a peculiar interest in it because
it would be her uncle’s, too, and Elizabeth was deeply
concerned in anything associated with her beloved
Miss Jewett, so the two little girls had many an
intimate talk over this new home.</p>

<p>“Uncle Rob says they are going to stay at Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
Dunbar’s till they get the house all furnished, and
they want to do it gradually,” Betsy informed her
friend. “They don’t want to go in until it looks
cosey and homelike, and the grounds are all cleared
up. Of course they are going to be gone for two
months on their honeymoon, and will buy most of
the things in the city before they come back. Won’t
it be fun, Elizabeth, to watch them fix up the house;
and won’t it be funny to say aunt Margaret instead
of Miss Jewett?”</p>

<p>Elizabeth sighed. “I wish she were going to be
my aunt Margaret, too,” she said.</p>

<p>“Maybe she will let you call her so,” said Betsy,
with a generous impulse. “I am going to ask her.”</p>

<p>“Oh Betsy, would you really!” Elizabeth’s face
was radiant.</p>

<p>“Why, certainly I will; but not yet, of course. I
couldn’t till she is really my aunt, you know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that will be soon enough,” agreed Elizabeth.
“I think it was lovely of you to think of that, Betsy.
What are you going to give her for a wedding
present?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know exactly, but something very, very
nice, of course.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>“Are you and Hal going to give something together,
or are you going to give something by yourself?”</p>

<p>“By myself. Hal is going to get it. Aunt Em is
going to give them all their flat silver, and probably
Hal and I will give silver, too. Mrs. Lynde is going
to give them something for the house,—a picture, I
think Bess said they were thinking of. Bess is going
to give a lamp or a clock, she hasn’t decided which.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth sighed again. It seemed hard that she
could not do as much when she was quite sure that
she loved Miss Jewett better than any of these others
did. “I don’t know what I shall give,—only some
little thing,” she confessed. “The family will give
something nice, I suppose, and Kathie is making
some pretty things by hand, things to wear, I mean.
Mother hasn’t told me whether I can give a separate
something or not, but I do so want to. I wish I
could hang her walls with wonderful tapestries, and
scatter articles of value all through her rooms. I
should like to drape her windows with silken hangings
and strew soft rugs for her dainty feet, and I
fain would crowd her galleries with lovely pictures to
gladden her eyes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>Betsy laughed. “She hasn’t any galleries, and
she wouldn’t like them crowded, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Oh Betsy, you are so very lateral,” said Elizabeth.
“You have so much unimagination. I was
just picturing to myself a lordly domicil for a favored
dame. I wish,—I wish,—I wish I could think of
something perfectly beautiful and dandy that I
could give her, but alas, Betsy, I am impecunrious.”</p>

<p>“You know perfectly well, Elizabeth, that she
will not care, and that she will value whatever you
give her much more than the gifts of some others I
could mention.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope so,” returned Elizabeth, somewhat
consoled. “I am going to ask Dick the next time
he comes home and perhaps he can help me out with
an original idea; he often does.”</p>

<p>But before Elizabeth saw Dick again a subject
came up which so excited her that even Miss Jewett’s
wedding present was a matter of less importance.
It was the very next morning after her talk with
Betsy that an announcement was made at school
which set all the older pupils to whispering and
wondering.</p>

<p>“Before we open school, children,” said Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
Jewett, “I want to say to you that two scholarships
have been established at the Academy. These are
open to the pupils of this school. One for the boys
and the other for the girls. There will be an examination
at the end of the term, but the record for
the year will be considered as well as the marks of
the examination papers. Of course this applies to
the older girls and boys only; those who are in our
highest class, I mean. Anyone over twelve years of
age, that is who has already entered his or her thirteenth
year, is eligible. Of course the time is short,
but I think it is better so as the regular work of the
year will be a fairer test of scholarship than a sudden
industrious spurt would be. I am not at liberty
just yet to make known the name of the person who
has established these scholarships, but this will be
done when the names of the fortunate winners are
announced.”</p>

<p>“When do we take the examinations?” spoke up
Phil Selden.</p>

<p>“The last week of the term,” Miss Jewett told
him. “Instead of the usual examinations, those
required by the Academy will be given. They will
be written ones, of course.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>With all good intention of settling down to work
with more than ordinary zeal, the larger boys and
girls could not keep their attention absolutely fixed
upon their books that morning. One or two of the
girls had already made their plans to go off to boarding-school,
but of those remaining there were
enough to make it a matter of competition, and what
a buzz there was when the hour of recess came. Bess
declared once and for all that she wasn’t going to
try. She would go to the Academy, anyhow, and
there wasn’t the slightest use in wearing out her
soul in making an effort to do more than merely pass.
Corinne wasn’t sure whether she would be in the
neighborhood another winter; it would depend upon
how long her parents remained abroad. Maria
Black was going to boarding-school and wasn’t
going to bother with an examination. Phil Selden
looked very determined when he said: “Well, I,
for one, am going to try my level best.” Bert was
outside the limit of age and did not concern himself.
Patsy McGonigle was a little older, being barely
twelve. He scratched his head and looked dubious,
but didn’t say whether he would enter the lists or not.</p>

<p>As for Elizabeth, she was so excited that she could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
scarcely speak. She mixed up her words more than
ever and went from tragedy to comedy by leaps.
“I shall simply respire if I don’t get it,” she cried.
“Oh dear, I wish a fairy would help me. Betsy,
who do you suppose is the saintly personage who has
done this benefacted deed? Is it male or female?
I would kiss his hand upon my bended knees.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it isn’t a he; maybe it is a she,” remarked
Betsy. “Oh, Elizabeth, perhaps it is your aunt
Eunice.”</p>

<p>“Ye shades of Venus! perhaps it is,” cried Elizabeth.
“Well, I won’t kiss her hand, and I won’t get
on my knees to her. Do you suppose it really could
be?”</p>

<p>“I think it could very well be, for you know we
are always hearing of the kind and charitable things
she does.”</p>

<p>“And it would be just like her to do it without
unclosing her name until the very last; she’s just
that kind of animal. I’ll bet it is she. The more I
think of it the more I am certain. Well, all is I
shall be on my most enduring mettle, steel or iron,
or whatever it may be. I shall burn the midnight
oil and I shall let the sickly hue of resolution be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
o’ercast by thought. Oh Betsy, I am so excited I
can scarcely retain myself within this narrow body.
When the fearsome day comes I shall call upon all
the saints, angels and ministers of grace to assist
me. If I fail, oh, if I should fail! Perish the unworthy
thought! but if I should, I know I shall fall
in a dead faint on the floor, and I shall have to be
borne out to an early grave. Of course you are going
to try.”</p>

<p>“I am going to try, I think, because I want a good
record, although I suppose I will go to the Academy
anyhow, for aunt Em has promised I should.”</p>

<p>“Suppose you should get it and I not!” cried
Elizabeth. “It would be the most heart-rending
tragedy.”</p>

<p>Betsy looked at her with startled eyes. “Oh
Elizabeth,” she said. “I never thought of that.
Maybe I will not try after all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but you must if you want to. I should not
be satisfied to have anyone make a sacrifice for me.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it will have to be as aunt Em and uncle
Rob say,” returned Betsy thoughtfully. “If they
insist upon it I shall have to, I suppose.”</p>

<p>So the matter was disposed of and the two went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
back into the schoolroom the more eager over their
studies than before.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was a bright scholar and Betsy was
not far behind. They both stood on a par with one
or two of the older girls, and felt that they had good
reasons for thinking they could compete with them.
Elizabeth poured forth her news at home with all
her usual exuberance. Betsy reported it more
quietly.</p>

<p>“Elizabeth, if you don’t do your level best,” cried
Kathie, “I shall want to shake you.”</p>

<p>“I shall not only want to shake myself,” replied
Elizabeth, “but I shall want to hide my undiminished
head in solitary places.”</p>

<p>“And if you do get it, what then?” asked Kathie,
laughing.</p>

<p>“I shall skip like the roe upon the mountain-top.
I shall sing hallelujahs with all my might, and my
soul will take wings to the firmament on high with
all the blue ethereal sky.”</p>

<p>“Well, my most emotional and dramatically
inclined sister, let me give you one piece of advice.
Don’t use high-flown language when you are writing
your examination papers, and try to acquire a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
correct use of words before you do any stunts in
English composition.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth looked sober. She was well aware
that her use of words was open to criticism, for Miss
Jewett was often quite severe upon her, but she did
so like to flourish high-sounding words. However,
it would be no time for the exercise of likes and dislikes,
she well knew, and she determined to make a
very earnest effort to curb her imagination when it
came to such an important thing as an examination.
“Kathie,” she said, very gravely, “I am really
going to try just as hard as I can. I am, I am. If
you see any way in which you can help me, please
do it, and I won’t answer back or anything; I will
take it as meekly as a lamb, I will, indeed. All you
will have to say if you see signs of rebellion——”</p>

<p>“There, now! stop right there,” cried Kathie.
“Couldn’t you say that more simply?”</p>

<p>Elizabeth flushed up. “What must I say? If you
see that I don’t like it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is better. Well, then?”</p>

<p>“If you see that I don’t like it,” Elizabeth improved
still further, “just don’t pay any attention,
but go on chiding. Is chiding right?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>“Perhaps it would be better to say: Go on correcting
me. Very well, honey, I will help you all I
can.”</p>

<p>“What am I going to give Miss Jewett?” asked
Elizabeth. “Betsy and I were talking about the
wedding presents, mother, and she and Bess are
both going to give something very, very nice.”</p>

<p>A little cloud came over Mrs. Hollins’s face. “I
wish you, too, could give something very, very nice,
but I am sure Miss Jewett will be quite as much
pleased with some simple thing. She knows you
are fond of her, and she also knows that we cannot
afford as much as some of our neighbors.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to give her, mother?”</p>

<p>“I am having a workstand put in order for her.
It is an old one which belonged to my grandmother.
We have another, and I thought I could spare this.
I know Miss Jewett wants one, for she has often
admired the one in my room. I think she will value
such a gift more than anything I could buy for her.”</p>

<p>“I think so, too, for I know she loves old furniture
when it is really nice. I am glad it is something for
her very own self. May I tell Betsy, mother?”</p>

<p>“If you like. Perhaps I can find something for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
you to give her. I had not really thought of your
making a separate gift, but I can readily understand
that you would like to.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth went off much heartened by this, but
the question passed out of her mind when she met
Betsy and was told that Miss Tyson and Betsy’s
uncle both thought it best that she should take the
examination. “It will establish your record, if it
does nothing more,” said Miss Emily. “Even if you
do not win the scholarship, your place in the Academy
will be understood. It would gratify me very much,
of course, if you were to win, although the money
consideration is a small part of it.”</p>

<p>“If anyone wins, I hope it will be Elizabeth,” returned
Betsy, “for she really needs it and I don’t.”</p>

<p>“That may be true, but as she has an equal chance
with the others, I do not think we should let her
opportunity outrank yours.”</p>

<p>So this was what Betsy had to report to her first
best, and Elizabeth felt that she must make her very
best endeavor to come out ahead of the rest. There
would be five girls to compete with and it was going
to be a close contest, she feared. The boys would
have an equally exciting time, and these last weeks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
of school promised to be the very busiest ones of the
year. It was well that Mr. Kemp was away, for
now there was no temptation to go to the studio.
Lessons were always the very first consideration,
and Elizabeth worked like a beaver over them.
Even the gray house did not see her very often.
There was less self-denial in this because Miss Darby
was still there, and although Elizabeth still believed
that she was the one who had offered the scholarships,
she had no great wish to come in contact with
the lady. With the scholarships, she might win her
great-aunt’s approval; if she did not win she felt
quite sure that she would be looked upon with
even less kindliness than at present. There was
much at stake, and these were stirring times for
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>The pleasanter subject of the approaching marriage
came in with a sort of tranquillizing effect. It
was the first wedding in which Elizabeth had ever
been personally interested, and every detail was
known by heart. Kathie was to be one of the
bridesmaids, and Hal one of the ushers. Although
the wedding ceremony would take place in the city
in which Miss Jewett had been living, it might be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
possible that Elizabeth could go. Betsy was determined
that she should, and had a little scheme of
her own which she hoped would work to advantage.
She was waiting till she should see her brother Hal
before she mentioned it to Elizabeth. She knew
Hal would fall in with the scheme and she thought
her uncle would, too, but she would bide her time.</p>

<p>So the lovely May days went by, full of so many
interests that, long as they were, they were all too
short for the things that must be accomplished, and
each brought nearer that day of the examinations.
Then one morning on the first day of June Elizabeth
heard a familiar call and saw Mr. Kemp swinging
along past the house. She ran out on the porch to
hail him.</p>

<p>He waved gayly to her. “Come over, come over,”
he called. “I can’t stop now, but come over just as
soon as you can.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br>

<small><span class="smcap">The Model’s Pay</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was not till lessons were well off her mind that
Elizabeth asked her mother’s permission to go
to the studio. “Don’t stay too long,” said her
mother as she gave her leave.</p>

<p>“I will try not,” answered Elizabeth, “but I shall
have such loads to talk about that I may forget. If
I am a little wee, wee bit late for supper, shall you
mind very much, mother?”</p>

<p>“Not if the bit is very wee. I think you’d better
ask Mr. Kemp to take supper with us and then there
will be no danger of your being detained.”</p>

<p>“That will be very nice,” agreed Elizabeth, “for
what we don’t finish saying we can keep on with as
we walk along. Please have waffles, mother; he
does like them so much and it will celebrate his
coming back.”</p>

<p>“I will see,” returned Mrs. Hollins, and Elizabeth
was satisfied. She found Mr. Kemp busy in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
studio, the door of which was opened wide to let
in the soft June air. The room was in a state of
confusion, sketches everywhere, and all sorts of
odds and ends lying about.</p>

<p>“Hello, Elfie,” he cried, as she appeared in the
doorway. “You are just in time to see my new
sketches before I put them away. I have done a
lot, haven’t I?”</p>

<p>Elizabeth looked around. “All these?” She
gave a comprehensive wave of the hand. “You
surely have been busy. I have been very busy, too.
Oh, Mr. Titian, I have so much to tell you that I
don’t know where to begin.”</p>

<p>“Then suppose you go and sit over there on the
model stand while I am sorting over these things,
and you can reel off all the yarns you like. Your
obedient servant will listen with both ears.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth went over and stepped up on the stand.
It was a rude affair which Mr. Kemp had made
himself. On it stood an antique chair, over the back
of which hung some draperies. It was a very familiar
seat to Elizabeth, for she had spent many an hour
in it. She established herself comfortably and began
to talk about the sketches, but Mr. Kemp interrupted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
her. “You aren’t telling me anything I don’t know,”
he said. “I want your news, not comments on my
work. That will keep.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth laughed, and launched forth upon an
account of all the happenings which had taken place
during the few weeks of her friend’s absence. Aunt
Eunice came in for her share of comment, so did
Miss Jewett’s wedding, but the paramount subject
was the scholarship.</p>

<p>After awhile she drew a long breath. Mr. Kemp
stopped in his task of stacking up canvases and said:
“Well, you have had stirring times. I certainly
hope you will get that scholarship, Elfie, and if
there is anything I can do to help just speak the
word.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose it is all in my eternal self,” returned
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“Do you by any chance mean internal?” inquired
Mr. Kemp, squinting up his eyes as he held off a
canvas at arm’s length.</p>

<p>“I suppose I do mean that,” responded Elizabeth.
“I am afraid that is where my rock of destruction
lies. Kathie is trying to help me and make me
use right words instead of wrong ones, but once in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
awhile I do make a slip, although I am really making
a superhuman effort to speak correctly.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kemp laughed. “I rather prefer the incorrectness,
myself,” he remarked. “It makes you a
much more original young person to have your own
special vocabulary.”</p>

<p>“But if it should interfere with my getting the
scholarship,” answered Elizabeth soberly.</p>

<p>“Oh, then, of course we must not encourage it.
I tell you what, though, Elfie; when the strain becomes
too great you come down here and let off your
sky-rocketty speech; in that way you will be easing
yourself and entertaining me.”</p>

<p>“I might do that,” agreed Elizabeth, rather glad
that she could relax from her watchfulness over her
speech. “Mr. Kemp, are you going to the wedding?”</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t know. I haven’t thought much
about it, to confess the truth. Are you going?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know yet. It is the ardent desire of my
heart, and if both Betsy and Bess are there I shall
feel a maiden all forlorn to be left at home. Not
to have a proper gift and to be deprived of such a
boon as attending the happy event is almost too
much for my equaliberum.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>Mr. Kemp looked up with a merry chuckle. “It
does me good to hear your old familiar manner of
speech, Elfie,” he said. “Why haven’t you a proper
gift for your beloved Miss Jewett?”</p>

<p>“Don’t cause me to enclose the state of the family
finances, Mr. Titian. I haven’t anything to buy
with; that is the whole truth.”</p>

<p>“I can sympathize with you because I have often
been in that condition myself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but you never need be without a beautiful
present to give when you have all these fine pictures.”</p>

<p>“That is what I always have to fall back upon,
my dear Elfie.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to give one to Miss Jewett?”
Elizabeth made bold to ask.</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t know her so very well, and I really
had not thought of giving her anything. I have
made her acquaintance only very recently, you see,
and Mr. Tyson I have met very seldom.”</p>

<p>“But you have known her as long, almost as long,
as you have me, and I am sure we are very intimate
friends,” returned Elizabeth, with the thought of
how well one of the pictures would look in the new
house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>“Oh, that cannot be so. Why, we have known
one another for ages. I can scarcely remember the
time when I didn’t know you, Elfie.”</p>

<p>“It was that day when I was getting the pussywillows,
that we met,” said Elizabeth reminiscently,
“and you were painting in the field.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kemp turned and began to rummage behind
some portfolios. Presently he brought out a canvas.
“And here it is,” he said. “It is better than I
thought, although I like that first real study I made
of you later on. I say, Elfie, how do you think this
would do for Miss Jewett’s wedding present?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am sure she would love it,” cried Elizabeth,
well pleased at the suggestion. “She was so delighted
with the pussywillows, and kept them on her
desk as long as they lasted.”</p>

<p>“And she wouldn’t object to the presence in the
picture of the one who gathered them, you think?”
Mr. Kemp looked up with a little half smile.</p>

<p>“Oh Mr. Titian, what a tease you are. I am sure
she would not mind, and as for myself it would make
me ecstatic to think that I was there and that every
time she looked at the picture she would see me.”</p>

<p>“Then, my dear Elfie, consider the picture yours.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>“What? You don’t mean that you are going to
give it to me to give to her?” Elizabeth jumped up
in sheer delight.</p>

<p>“Why, what else?”</p>

<p>“I thought you meant you, yourself, were going
to give it. Oh Mr. Titian, I think it is too much
for you to do. I don’t think I ought to take it.”</p>

<p>“You don’t? Well, my dear child, let me tell you
that I certainly think I owe you something for sitting
for me so patiently and often. A model costs
something, you know, and if you will take this in
payment for sitting, why, we’ll call it quits.” He
picked up the picture again and advancing toward
the model stand dropped on one knee and held it
out. “May it please your Majesty to accept this
poor offering from you leal knight,” he said.</p>

<p>Elizabeth snatched up a piece of dull brocade
from the chair, held it around her so that it made a
trailing drapery and swept to the edge of the stand.
“We are pleased to accept your offering, Sir Knight,”
she said, “and you may kiss our hand.”</p>

<p>This ceremony accomplished, she flung aside the
drapery and jumped down. “Oh Mr. Titian,” she
said, “I think you are the darlingest artist man that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
was ever born. Do you really, really think I have
earned this? It is so much, so very much nicer to
feel that I have.”</p>

<p>“I consider that you surely have earned it,” replied
Mr. Kemp. “Let us see if we can find some
sort of simple frame for it. You don’t know how
much better it will look in a frame.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but that would be too much.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it. I have worked over this a little
since that first day, and I may give it one or two
more touches. You can leave it here and I will see
what sort of frame I can find.”</p>

<p>This Elizabeth was ready to do. “If I had
searched the world over I couldn’t have found anything
I would rather give,” she said, then asked, “Are
you very sure, Mr. Titian, that you might not be
able to sell it for a great deal of money and that you
will not be sorry tomorrow that you gave it to me?”</p>

<p>“Far be it from me to have any such feeling. I
have been paid for it in better coin than gold of the
realm, my lady. Your gracious appreciation of my
poor gift is worth more than pearls and diamonds.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kemp knew that this sort of talk delighted
Elizabeth and that it would reassure her as ordinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
language might not. She fairly bubbled over with
delight as she said: “There isn’t anyone, I don’t
care who, that will have anything finer to give.
Who cares for silver when they can have pictures?”</p>

<p>“Elfie, my sweet child, you voice my ideas exactly,”
Mr. Kemp assured her. “Have I any silver?
Not an ounce. I bought my spoons at the Five-and-Ten-cent
store and they serve me well. I enjoy my
simple fare quite as much while partaking it from—shall
we say near-silver, or shall we speak the truth
and call it tin?—I repeat: I spurn your gold, and
hug my pictures to my heart.” He suited the
action to the word.</p>

<p>Elizabeth nodded wisely. “I think I am happier
than Bess or Corinne,” she said thoughtfully, “and
yet I haven’t half so much.”</p>

<p>“We are philosophers, Elfie. We belong to that
happy class who have riches the world wots not of.
But, I say, speaking of things to eat, didn’t you say
something about waffles?”</p>

<p>“I said that I thought we might be going to have
them. Is it time? It can’t be.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kemp consulted his watch. “It is so near
that there isn’t any fun in it. I don’t want to miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
anything that is coming to me. Waffles and honey,
is it?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, honey, of course, and maybe chicken.
I am not sure.”</p>

<p>“Yum-yum!” exclaimed her friend. “We cannot
waste another moment. Come along, Elfie.”</p>

<p>They went forth and reached the house just as
Electra was bringing in the first plate of waffles.
“I was a wee, wee bit late,” acknowledged Elizabeth,
when all had welcomed back Mr. Kemp, “but
if you knew, mother, what a joyous thing has happened
you would not be grudging of the extra
minutes.”</p>

<p>“Hush, hush!” warned Mr. Kemp; “wait till
after supper, please, Elfie. You will spoil my appetite
if you bring up embarrassing subjects.”</p>

<p>So Elizabeth did not tell her news till she had her
mother all to herself. “Isn’t it the most joyful present
that could be?” she said. “Oh mother, I am so
happy about it that even if I can’t go to the wedding
I shall not mind so much.”</p>

<p>“But you are going,” replied her mother with a
smile.</p>

<p>“Oh mother, tell me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>“Betsy came over awhile ago and said her uncle
wanted her to say that he specially wanted you to
go with Betsy as her guest, and he added that he
would not feel himself really married unless you
were there to see that the contract was carried out
properly.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that just like him?” Elizabeth laughed.
“I do love Mr. Robert, although he will never get
done teasing me about contracts. I love so many
people, mother. Everyone is so perfectly lovely to
me; I mean everyone except aunt Eunice. I am so
happy, that I could even love her if she would let
me.”</p>

<p>“Bless your heart, child, I believe you could,”
replied her mother, kissing her.</p>

<p>“May I wear my yellow dress to the wedding?”
inquired Elizabeth. “Will it be suitable,
mother?”</p>

<p>“I was thinking of a new white one, but if
you would rather wear the yellow I have no
objection.”</p>

<p>“I think I would rather,” agreed Elizabeth. “I
suppose there is no chance of my being so favored as
to have a new hat,” she added wistfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>“Why, my dear, I don’t know. I will do my best.
What would you like?”</p>

<p>“Oh, if I could have a yellowish one with nasturtiums
on it I would love it.”</p>

<p>“Well, dear, I cannot promise, but I will do my
best. I realize that it is an important occasion, but
you see there are so many things to get for Kathie’s
bridesmaid dress, that I am afraid you must come
out at the little end of the horn.”</p>

<p>“Oh well, never mind,” said Elizabeth cheerfully.
“Maybe I would be too happy if I had everything
I want. Could I go down and see Betsy just a little
while? I want to thank her for coming up and I
want to thank her for inviting me; Mr. Robert, too,
I want to thank him, too, and I want to tell Betsy
about the picture. I don’t see how I can wait till
morning, mother.”</p>

<p>Her mother laughed. “I don’t see how you can
either. I never saw such an excited little body. At
this rate what will you be by the time all these
unusual things are over?”</p>

<p>Elizabeth gave a long sigh. “Now you remind me
of that fearsome examination. It stares me in the
face like a sheeted ghost.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>“Don’t think about it, dear child. Run along to
Betsy and I will let Electra stop and bring you
home; she is going down into the village.”</p>

<p>So Elizabeth danced away to Betsy, and if their
tongues did not run it was not because they had
nothing to talk about.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br>

<small><span class="smcap">The Locked Door</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE dreaded day at last arrived. Elizabeth was
so nervous that her mother felt a deep compassion
for the child. “I almost wish there were no
scholarship to be won,” she said to her husband.
“Elizabeth is such an intense sort of little body that
I am afraid she will be actually ill if she fails.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe she is going to fail,” returned Mr.
Hollins hopefully.</p>

<p>Betsy was almost as anxious as Elizabeth, not for
herself, for all that she really cared for was to get a
worthy mark, but she did care very much for Elizabeth.
Corinne had withdrawn from the race, as she
had received word that her parents would return
before long. There were, then, but four contestants
to look upon as rivals, for the two great friends.</p>

<p>“Oh, Elizabeth, I do hope and pray you will get
it,” whispered Betsy, as they took their places.
Elizabeth was beyond words, but she gave Betsy’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
hand a nervous squeeze, and by the coldness of the
eager fingers Betsy knew the state of Elizabeth’s
feelings.</p>

<p>It was a solemn-faced little company which Miss
Jewett overlooked, but she gave each an encouraging
smile, as she told them to sit one desk apart in alternate
rows. She explained what the work would be
and herself wrote the first set of questions on the
board.</p>

<p>The children fell to work with eagerness. There
was not a sound except a sigh from one or another
overwrought heart, the subdued rustle of papers,
and the scratching of pens. At the end of the first
hour the papers were collected. That much over,
Elizabeth felt rather confident that she had answered
all her questions correctly. So far, good.</p>

<p>Next came an examination in United States history.
Facts Elizabeth was familiar with, and she
expected to be able to answer every question rightly.
She went over them carefully and began her answers,
writing with precision and making an effort
to use simple words. She went on swimmingly until
about half her work was done, then she suddenly
came to a halt. The date of the battle of Alamance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
Alamance? Alamance? What did she know about
it? For the life of her she could not think. She
looked at the board and back again at her paper.
She glanced at the clock. She looked over at Betsy.
Finally she concluded that she would leave the question
for awhile and go back to it when she had finished
the rest. This she did, finding no further
trouble. The time was almost up when she again
cudgelled her brains. She became more and more
nervous as the moments sped. Why was she so
stupid? What was the matter with her that this
thing had failed to stick in her memory? She felt
desperate.</p>

<p>Betsy, looking up, caught the distressed expression
and knew that something had gone wrong.
Her own paper was about complete. She had remembered
all about Alamance, even to the exact
date. There it was plainly written: “May 16, 1771.”
She wondered what it was that was troubling Elizabeth.
Of course she could not ask, but she did so
wish that she knew. Supposing Elizabeth were to
get a lower mark than herself and thus lose the scholarship.
That would never do. Betsy looked down
at her neat paper which showed correct answers to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
the ten questions given. She looked over at Elizabeth’s
sheet lying spread out before her, and saw a
blank space which came, she guessed, in about the
place where the answer to Alamance should be.
Elizabeth’s two hands were buried in her curly locks,
her eyes were fixed on the paper, but she did not
make a move to write anything further. The hands
of the clock were approaching the close of the hour;
in another minute the papers must be handed in.
As if knowing that Betsy was watching her, she turned
around and gave her a despairing look. The clock
struck the hour. There was a rustle of papers as
the different contestants gathered them up. Betsy
dipped her pen in the ink, hastily made a mark which
converted 1771 into 1774 and took up her paper.
Elizabeth hurriedly scribbled something in the blank
space, feeling that an error was better than nothing,
and followed Betsy.</p>

<p>The rest of the day went fairly enough. All were
earnest and serious, and did their very best. At last
it was over; the long dreaded moments had actually
passed. With a smile Miss Jewett dismissed them.
“I can at least attest to your having been good
workers,” she said. “I never saw such very deep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
interest. I wish there was a scholarship for each
one of you, but as it is I can only wish good-luck
to you all. We shall see how it comes out by day
after tomorrow, I think.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth and Betsy clasped hands as they went
out the door. “It is over,” said Elizabeth, “and I
feel like a rag. I think I did pretty well with most
of the questions, though I did get rattled over the
history. There was one question that I couldn’t
seem to get, and I waited, hoping it would come to
me, but it didn’t and at the very last minute I just
put down something. Oh Betsy, I wonder if you
know the date of the battle of Alamance. What
did you put down?”</p>

<p>“I put down May 16, 1774,” replied Betsy calmly.</p>

<p>“And I said 1775; I wonder which is right. I
shall look the minute I get home. I don’t see why
they picked out a little unimportant thing like that
to ask us.”</p>

<p>“But it isn’t unimportant,” declared Betsy. “It
was really the first strike for freedom; it was in North
Carolina, you know, long before Concord and Lexington
and all that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me, so it was. I remember all about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
it now. How very stupid of me to forget. It all
comes back to me now, but, Betsy, I think it was even
earlier than we have made it; I don’t believe either
one of us is right.”</p>

<p>“Then if we are both wrong there is no harm
done,” said Betsy with a smile.</p>

<p>“How can we live till day after tomorrow?”
Elizabeth went on.</p>

<p>“We shall have to think about the wedding and
that will take our minds off unpleasant things,” returned
Betsy. Then they fell to discussing this great
event and no more was said about the battle of
Alamance then or at any other time, for Betsy kept
her own counsel.</p>

<p>If the two girls were excited on the day of the examinations
they were more so on that morning when
Miss Jewett announced that she was ready to give
the name of the successful competitors. You could
have heard a pin drop in the schoolroom. Two
fiery spots burned in Elizabeth’s cheeks. Betsy was
very pale, even Bess looked less placid than usual,
for she really was most anxious that Elizabeth
should win. Phil Selden nervously fingered a pencil,
then thrust his hands in his pockets and sat with eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
fixed on his desk. Patsy McGonigle looked around
with a broad grin.</p>

<p>“I will first tell you,” said Miss Jewett, “that it
is Mr. Henry Gilmore who has established these
scholarships, and I am sure he—” but the clapping
of hands broke in upon the sentence. Elizabeth
clapped more vigorously than any of the rest. Dear
Grandpa Gil, why had she never thought of its being
him? She was conscious that in case of success she
would be thankful that it was not aunt Eunice to
whom she must offer her thanks.</p>

<p>Miss Jewett looked around with an indulgent
smile. “That is right,” she said. “I am glad you
all feel like applauding. I do myself. The boy who
received the highest marks in the examination is
Patsy McGonigle.” For some reason everyone
giggled, and Patsy turned very red, squirming in his
seat most awkwardly. “I must say that Patsy’s
record in school is good, too, except in the matter
of deportment,” Miss Jewett went on; “but even
that does not place him so low as to lose him the
scholarship. The next, I may state, is Phil Selden,
who lacks very little of being even with Patsy. The
trustees give Phil honorable mention.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>This, however, appeared small comfort to Phil,
who looked as if he could cry. He did want that
scholarship so badly, and to be outdone by a little
rascal like Patsy was almost too much. Patsy’s grin
had disappeared. Even when Bert thumped him on
the back, this being his way of offering congratulations,
Patsy only squirmed away, and presently
arose to his feet. “Miss Jewett, ma’am,” he said,
“might I speak a wurrud?”</p>

<p>“To be sure, Patsy,” replied Miss Jewett.</p>

<p>“Me mother was sayin’, Miss Jewett,” Patsy
began, “that was I to git the scholarship, she’d be
turr’ble proud, but afther all, ma’am, she was thinkin’
I was full young to be goin’ so far to school, and how
would I be gittin’ there, says she, an’, I bein’ the oldest,
how would she git at me if me father was took
worse or one av the little ones fell in the fire or annything
like that, an’, says she, ‘Patsy, me boy, I
think ye’d best not be thinkin’ of it for another
year. Ye’ll be gettin’ good schoolin’ enough where
ye are, for awhile, and, says she, if so be it comes
to ye, just ye be thankin’ the schoolmistress and say
ye’ll be stayin’ where ye are for awhile yet.’” Then
Patsy sat down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>Miss Jewett threw a smiling glance at Phil. “If
that is so, Patsy,” she said, “then of course the scholarship
will go to Phil Selden; you know that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am. It’s all right.”</p>

<p>“I congratulate you both,” Miss Jewett said, “but
we must not talk about this any more just now, for
I know there are some very anxious girls here. I
won’t keep them waiting a moment longer. The
scholarship for the girls goes to Miss Elizabeth
Hollins.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Elizabeth could not refrain from an
ecstatic exclamation. She clutched Betsy fiercely.</p>

<p>“Honorable mention is given to Betsy Tyson,”
Miss Jewett went on. “The contest was very close,
but Elizabeth came out a little ahead.”</p>

<p>A soft color suffused Betsy’s face and she cast down
her eyes. How glad, how very glad she was of that
little mark which made a figure one into a four.</p>

<p>Elizabeth flew home on wings of joy. It seemed
to her as if her feet scarcely touched the earth.
She rushed into the house pell-mell, crying out,
“Where is mother? Where is Kathie? It’s mine!
It’s mine!”</p>

<p>Electra appeared from the kitchen. “What’s all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
this to-do about?” she asked. “Your mother and
Miss Kathie have both gone up to your Cousin
Belle’s.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth did not wait for anything further, but
was out of the door like a flash, and racing up the
street as if running for a wager. They were all gathered
on the porch when she reached the gray house,
her mother, Kathie, cousin Belle, Grandpa Gil,
Ruth and aunt Eunice. The presence of the last-mentioned
did not dampen Elizabeth’s enthusiasm
on this occasion, and she rushed into the midst of
the group, throwing herself into her mother’s arms,
crying: “I’ve got it! It’s mine! It’s mine!”</p>

<p>Aunt Eunice looked at her severely. “What is
hers?” she asked Mrs. Gilmore.</p>

<p>“Is it the scholarship?” cried Kathie. “Oh,
Elizabeth, have you really won it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I have, I have!” replied Elizabeth in tones
of triumph. Then she rushed over to Grandpa Gil
and wound her arms around his neck. “Oh, dearest,
dearest Grandpa Gil,” she said. “I know now that
it was you; it was all you who did it.” Then suddenly,
without another word, she collapsed upon the
floor and began to sob from sheer excitement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>“There, there, dear child,” expostulated Grandpa
Gil, “don’t do that. Why, I thought you wanted to
win, and now will you cry about it? Come here and
dry your eyes. I want to whisper something to you.”</p>

<p>“I’m—I’m crying,” stammered Elizabeth, “because
all my laugh is used up and there are no commotions
left but the crying ones.”</p>

<p>Then everyone, even aunt Eunice, laughed; and
Elizabeth recovered sufficiently to go to Grandpa
Gil and hear what he had to say.</p>

<p>“I counted on your winning,” he whispered,
“and that is the chief reason why there is a scholarship
at all.”</p>

<p>“So you have actually won the scholarship,” aunt
Eunice’s clear, crisp voice came in. “I am very
much pleased with you, Elizabeth. I confess I
didn’t expect it was in you. Come here, my child.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth left Grandpa Gilmore’s side, where she
would much rather be, and went to her aunt. “I
wish to show my appreciation of your good effort,”
said aunt Eunice, “and should like you to accept
this. You will probably need new school books,
and it will go toward the purchase of them.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth’s hand closed over a coin which aunt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
Eunice put into it. “Thank you very much,” she
said quietly. “I am glad I have done something to
please you, aunt Eunice,” she added.</p>

<p>Miss Darby looked at her great-niece sharply.
She did not know whether the remark was made in
sarcasm or not, but, seeing Elizabeth’s innocent look,
she assumed a more amiable expression. “The
money is yours to do with as you please,” she said.
“Your mother can help you decide upon the best
use to make of it. I only suggested the books.”
Aunt Eunice restored her pocket-book to the little
bag from which she had taken it and Elizabeth felt
herself dismissed.</p>

<p>Of course, there were congratulations from all the
rest, and there were many questions about the other
contestants. Elizabeth gave a humorous account
of Patsy’s speech. She was a good mimic and imitated
him perfectly. Then she must run home to
tell her father the glad news, and as it was time to
end their own visit, Mrs. Hollins and Kathie left too.</p>

<p>“What was it aunt Eunice gave you?” asked
Kathie, as they were walking down the shady road.</p>

<p>“I haven’t looked,” said Elizabeth, opening her
hand in which she held the coin. “Why, it’s gold,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
she exclaimed. “It felt so little that I didn’t think
it was more than a dime. How much is it, mother?
I don’t know much about gold pieces.”</p>

<p>Her mother looked at it. “Why, it is five dollars,
my dear.”</p>

<p>“Really? Why, I don’t believe I expressed my
gratification half pleasedly enough. Do you think
I ought to go back and do it over again?”</p>

<p>“No, my dear; I think you have said quite as
much as can be required of you,” her mother replied,
to Elizabeth’s relief.</p>

<p>The child looked wistfully down at the money in
her hand. “I never had so much,” she said. “Do
you think I should spend it on school books, mother?”</p>

<p>“Why, my dear child, I think that as you have
done so well and have made it so easy for us all that
the least we can do is to buy your books for you.
You shall do just as aunt Eunice said; spend it as
you please.”</p>

<p>“Oh mother, would it buy the hat?”</p>

<p>“I am sure it would.”</p>

<p>“Then may I? May I?”</p>

<p>“If that will please you the most, you may, assuredly.
Kathie must make one more trip to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
city before the wedding and you might go with her
to select what you would like.”</p>

<p>“Will you take me, Kathie? I beseech you with
all the ardency of my nature.”</p>

<p>“Why, of course I will,” responded her sister
heartily. “I think if we get the hat untrimmed and
the flowers separate, that I can trim it and it will
not cost so much, or we can get finer flowers for it
in that way.”</p>

<p>And so the nasturtium hat was bought, and Elizabeth’s
cup of happiness was full. Betsy was no less
happy. She had received high praise from her aunt
and uncle, who said that she had done them credit,
and that they were quite as well pleased with her
honorable mention as with the scholarship; in fact,
they were more pleased because she had so nearly
won it, and as things were it was better that Elizabeth
should be first.</p>

<p>Loyal, good, little Betsy said never a word about
the battle of Alamance, but took the praise sedately
and turned her thoughts to the wedding, now but a
few days off.</p>

<p>As for the event itself, it was like most others, except
that among the guests rarely are three happier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
girls than those who sat side by side, one in yellow,
one in white and one in blue, and who were the first
to kiss the bride after her own family had done so.</p>

<p>They all rode home together in the gloaming, tired
but very, very content. The new house for the newer
Mrs. Tyson loomed up among the trees. Opposite
stood the schoolhouse, silent and deserted.</p>

<p>“The door is locked,” murmured Elizabeth to
Betsy, “locked for us always.”</p>

<p>“Why, no, it isn’t,” returned Betsy. “We can
go in if we like sometimes.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean just that,” replied Elizabeth, with
a backward look at the familiar door; but Betsy
did not follow the flight of Elizabeth’s thoughts,
which were already speeding on through future
years.</p>
